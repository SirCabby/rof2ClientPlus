# rof2ClientPlus — client-interface porting notes (TAKP → stock RoF2)

Working notes for repointing the vendored Zeal (TAKP) interface to the stock
**Rain of Fear 2** client. Zeal is MIT; addresses here are facts about the same
`eqgame.exe` we target, cross-checked against the locally-cloned **eqlib**
(MacroQuest, GPL — used as a fact-reference only; this project stays MIT).

## Target binary
- `/home/joshua/Games/RoF2/eqgame.exe` — build **May 10 2013**, md5 `e9d416c6de6b53008ae00c2b16bbfd6c`.
- eqlib fact-reference: `/home/joshua/workspace/GitHub/eqlib` (offsets in
  `include/eqlib/offsets/eqgame.h`, structs in `include/eqlib/game/*.h`).

## Regenerating the disassembly (scratchpad is session-specific — it will be gone)
```
objdump -d eqgame.exe > eqgame.asm      # AT&T syntax, what the notes below quote
```
Reading raw floats/vtables straight from the PE in python:
- `.rdata`: file offset = `VA - 0x9c0000 + 0x5be800`
- Confirmed: PE image base makes `.text` run ~`0x401000..0x9c0000`.

## Build / install / test loop
- `make && make install` → drops `rof2ClientPlus.asi` (+ `uifiles/rcp/` + fonts) into `/home/joshua/Games/RoF2/`.
- The Makefile now uses `-MMD -MP` + `-include *.d` header-dependency tracking. Before that it did
  NOT track headers, so editing a shared header (e.g. bumping a constant like `kRoleCount` in
  `rcp_options_ui.h`) without also touching its `.cpp` left a STALE `.o` — which shipped a mismatched
  build (symptom: new color-role buttons unmanaged/uncontained). If ever in doubt, `make clean`.
- Runtime log: `/home/joshua/Games/RoF2/rof2ClientPlus.log`. Wine log: `eq-last-run.log`.
- The user launches via `/home/joshua/Games/RoF2/launch-eq.sh` (direct `wine eqgame.exe patchme`).

## Out-of-band artifacts — what `make install` does NOT ship
`make install` delivers the `.asi`, the option-window overrides (into `uifiles/default/` — see the
UI note two paragraphs down), the mod fonts/target-rings (`uifiles/rcp/`), and `eq-window-fix`.
The **model-swap feature** additionally needs runtime data that is neither in git nor installed by
that target, and was for a while only reproducible from the built binaries themselves:
- **29 `rcp*.s3d` classic-model archives** (~59 MB) in the game root, and
- an edit to **`$GAME_DIR/Resources/GlobalLoad.txt`** (the archive-load manifest — the DLL never
  writes it) so the client loads those archives.

These are now automated and reproducible: **`make models`** regenerates all 29 from source archives
(`tools/build_models.py`, the recipe of record — 25/29 rebuild byte-identical, verified 2026-07-17),
and **`make install-models`** deploys them + patches GlobalLoad.txt (`tools/patch_globalload.py`,
idempotent). A full deploy is `make install && make install-models`. Build sources + a verbatim copy
of the outputs are kept in `~/Games/RoF2-modelswap-backup/`. Full detail: **`docs/MODEL_ASSETS.md`**;
overview + the SAFE-vs-at-risk map: **`CLAUDE.md`**. Server-side faction-vision is a separate stack
(`~/workspace/GitHub/akk-stack`, pushed to SirCabby GitHub forks).

**UI overrides now live in the client's `uifiles/default/` (base skin), not `uifiles/rcp/` (2026-07-17).**
`/rcpoptions` ships as a **standalone `EQUI_RcpOptions.xml`** in `$GAME_DIR/uifiles/default/`, pulled in by
a one-line `<Include>` added to a copy of stock `EQUI.xml` (also in `default/`); `EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml` +
`EQUI_AdvancedDisplayOptionsWnd.xml` are separate widened-text overrides. So `/rcpoptions` loads under ANY UI
skin that inherits `default/EQUI.xml`, and users can run a custom skin on top. `make install` **overwrites 3
stock files** (`EQUI.xml` + the 2 option windows), saving each pristine copy ONCE as `*.rcpbak`
(`bakstock()` refuses to re-back-up over our own file, matched by the "rof2ClientPlus UI override" marker;
`EQUI_RcpOptions.xml` carries that marker too so a pure mod file is never backed up). `uifiles/rcp/` is now
only mod assets (fonts + target-rings); generators read vendored pristine stock (`tools/stock-uifiles/`) and
write to repo `uifiles/default/`.

**The "a standalone window file crashes the UI parse" belief was DISPROVEN 2026-07-17.** The real culprit
was the mod's RUNTIME include-merge (the old `LoadSidlHk` wrote a temp `EQUI.xml` with the `<Include>` merged
in and had the client re-parse it via `WriteTemporaryUI`). A STATIC on-disk `<Include>` in the skin's real
`EQUI.xml`, parsed by the client's own native UI load, takes the full 129-control window fine (confirmed
in-game). So the `XMLRead`/`WriteTemporaryUI` redirect is gone; `LoadSidl` (0x5992c0) stays hooked ONLY to
drop `RcpOptionsUI`'s cached handles on any `EQUI.xml` (re)load — `/loadskin` rebuilds the UI in-game and
frees our window, and the frame poll would otherwise deref a freed control (access-violation crash). **That
hook must NOT use `rcp->callbacks`: `CallbackManager` is never instantiated in this build (null pointer) — a
null-deref in the `RcpOptionsUI` ctor crashed char-select mid-session before this was caught.**

---

## Phase 1 — first-person mouse-look — DONE (confirmed by user)
Lives in `src/mouse_mods.cpp` (the `/rcpcam` feature). All addresses are in the
file's comments. Summary of the mechanism + the RE behind it:

**Root cause of the old stair-stepping:** the stock turn function `0x516d40`
loads the mouse delta with `fildl` (INTEGER→float), so a slow axis's sparse
whole counts (`0,0,0,1`) become visible pitch jumps. Rewriting the integer
DInput buffer can't fix it (no sub-count precision).

**Fix:** hook `IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState` (mouse device vtable at
`0xE67B50`, slot 9), and while looking (`MouseLook 0xDDF702` && right btn
`0xDDF73D`) reproduce the client's turn math in FLOAT on a low-pass-smoothed
delta, applied directly to the controlled entity, then zero the buffer
(`0xE67884` lX / +4 lY) so the client's own integer turn is suppressed.

**Client turn calibration (extracted from `0x516d40`):**
- `S = (mouseSensIni - 1) * 0.1428571 * 1.5 + 0.5`  (mouseSensIni @ `0xDDF69C`)
- yaw   `= (dx / screen_width)  * 512 * S`
- pitch `= (dy / screen_height) * 256 * S`
- screen: left `0xDDF620`, right `0xDDF628`, top `0xDDF624`, bottom `0xDDF62C`
- Applied as: `Heading -= dyaw` (wrap 0..512), `Pitch -= dpitch` (clamp ±128).
  Note pitch sign is **negated** (mouse-up looks up). Yaw written by the client
  as a *rate* to SpeedHeading — we zero SpeedHeading@0x8c to cancel it.

**Controlled entity + offsets (eqlib PlayerClient, cross-checked in disasm):**
- controlled player ptr `*(void**)0xDD2644` (self/mount/charm; local player is `0xDD2630`)
- `Heading @ 0x80`, `SpeedHeading @ 0x8c`, `CameraAngle(pitch) @ 0x90`
- Gated to first person only via `cameraType == 0` (`0xD1FD9C`); other camera
  modes fall through to the client's native turn (Phase 2 territory).

---

## Phase 2 — third-person chase camera — DONE
Lives in `src/chase_cam.cpp` (the `/rcpchase` feature), a **self-contained** module
in the mouse_mods.cpp style. The vendored `src/camera_mods.cpp` is a TAKP reference
only and **cannot be address-swapped**: RoF2's camera model is fundamentally
different (see below), so it stays unconstructed.

### Key architecture finding — RoF2 ≠ TAKP camera model
- Stock RoF2 uses **polymorphic `EQCamera` objects** (each with a vtable) in a
  pointer array; TAKP used one flat `CameraInfo` struct array. So there is **no
  single `DoCamAI`** to hook — positioning is a per-camera **vtable method**.
- **The vendored `camera_mods.cpp` `DoCamAI 0x4db384` is a switch JUMP TABLE in
  RoF2, not a function — hooking it would crash.** (Confirmed.)
- **The mouse-wheel chase camera is `cameraType 6` (`Cameras[6]@0xDE0D7C`), NOT 2.**
  The vendored enum `RcpCam=2` is TAKP. In RoF2, F9's `CHASE_CAMERA`=2 is a
  *separate* camera from the wheel-out follow camera (=6). ZealCam replaces the
  wheel one, so we target **6**.

### Confirmed stock-RoF2 addresses (all disasm-verified)
- **cameraType (int) `0xD1FD9C`**: 0=first person, 6=wheel chase. CDisplay ptr `0xDD2660`.
- **Cameras array `0xDE0D64`** (`EQCamera*[8+]`): active = `*(EQCamera**)(0xDE0D64+cameraType*4)`.
  Slots→vtables (from init `0x5338A0`): [0]fp `0x9d0f80`, [1]overhead `0x9d10c8`,
  [2]F9-chase `0x9d1108`, [3/4]user `0x9d1148`, [5] `0x9d11c8`, **[6]wheel-follow `0x9d1188`**.
- **EQCamera layout** (eqlib `EQData.h`): `Y@0x04 X@0x08 Z@0x0c`,
  `Orientation_Y@0x10 Orientation_X@0x14 Orientation_Z@0x18` (**the renderer reads
  position 0x04/0x08/0x0c + orientation 0x10/0x14/0x18**), `Heading@0x28 Height@0x2c
  Pitch@0x30 Distance@0x34 DirectionalHeading@0x38 Zoom@0x40 bAutoPitch@0x44 bAutoHeading@0x45`.
- **Per-frame camera driver `0x796DD0`** (called from `RealRender_World 0x49CA10`
  at `0x49CE5B`): calls `Cameras[cameraType]->vtable[0x08](viewActor)` then reads
  the camera's position+orientation into the renderer. Do NOT tail-hook this (too late).
- **Cam6 positioner = `0x799140`** (vtable `0x9d1188` slot +0x08), `__thiscall(EQCamera*
  ecx, PlayerClient* actor)`, `ret $4`, first 5 bytes `83 ec 30 56 57` = clean detour.
  Writes Position (via `0x490f60`) + Orientation. Native uses smoothed
  `DirectionalHeading@0x38` for orbit position, raw entity `Heading@0x80` for look.
  Orientation_X native = `Pitch@0x30 − 8.5` (`0xa002e0`). **← our tail-hook target.**
- **Mouse-wheel game handler `0x518A70`** (`__thiscall`, this=`*(void**)0xE67CCC`,
  arg=wheelDelta; called from `ProcessMouseEvents 0x539E60` at `0x53A186`). Native
  path toggles cameraType `0↔6` via **`SetCameraType 0x48ADF0`** (`__stdcall(int)`,
  writes `0xD1FD9C`), zoom accumulator `CEverQuest+0x5EC` clamped to
  `[min, gfMaxZoomCameraDistance 0x9D0DE4 = 53.0]`. (Note: eqlib's `0x5F9C90` is only
  the low-level DInput wheel accumulator → `0xE67B64`, NOT the game handler.)
- **PlayerClient offsets** (controlled `*(PlayerClient**)0xDD2644`, self `0xDD2630`;
  eqlib + disasm): pos `Y@0x64 X@0x68 Z@0x6c` (feet), `Heading@0x80` (0..512),
  `CameraAngle/pitch@0x90`, `SpeedHeading@0x8c`, `AvatarHeight@0x138` (head height),
  `Height@0x13c`, `Type@0x125` (Player=1), `Properties@0x128` (CharacterPropertyHash =
  bodytype), `Targetable@0x160` (bool, "true if mob is targetable"), `Race@0xeb4`,
  `SpawnID@0x148`, `Mount@0x154`, `WhoFollowing(autofollow)@0xe40`, viewactor
  `mActorClient@0xea4 + pActor@0x101c` (`CActorInterface*`, all-virtual; BoundingRadius
  vtable +0x60/+0x64). Struct reference: `GitHub/eqlib/include/eqlib/game/PlayerClient.h`
  matches this client field-for-field. Nameplates hide untargetable "controller"/trigger
  NPCs (EQEmu zone_controller etc.) by blanking when `Type==NPC && !Targetable` (MQ2's
  UNTARGETABLE/TRIGGER/TRAP/TIMER buckets all reduce to untargetable).
- Phase-3 refs: `SetViewActor 0x48F030` (bad-cam msg patch: `0x48F091` `74 27`→`EB 27`),
  `GetClickedActor 0x48B6B0`, exact eye-height virtual `0x0058CF00` (thiscall).

**Status — WORKING (user-confirmed); confirmed addresses above retained as reference:**
1. **2b chase positioning (`src/chase_cam.cpp`, WORKING)** — tail-detour `0x799140`;
   while enabled && `cameraType==6`, reuse the client's OWN computed camera-behind
   vector `(camPos−playerPos)` (correct direction, honors left-click orbit, keeps
   player centered) and only **rescale distance** along it + optional **Z height
   raise**; orientation left native. Off by default; `/rcpchase on|off|dist
   <n|native>|height <n>`, ini `[Chase]`.
   - *Earlier v1 (superseded) recomputed the orbit with `get_cam_pos_behind` +
     forced look=Heading → camera went in-front and player off-centre. Lesson:
     don't recompute the orbit; reuse the client's vector.*
2. **Mouse sensitivity in third person (`src/mouse_mods.cpp`, WORKING)** — the
   `/rcpcam` float-turn now engages in `cameraType==0` AND `cameraType==6` (was
   first-person only). In chase view it drives heading (turn) + suppresses the
   native horizontal turn, leaving `lY`/pitch to the native camera.
3. **Options window (`src/rcp_options_ui.cpp` + `uifiles/rcp/*.xml`, WORKING)** —
   sliders/checkbox now live. Three bugs were fixed: (a) **service creation race** —
   `ProcessGameEvents_hk` could build two `RcpService` instances, so `on_frame`
   polled a different (empty) options object than `/rcpoptions` built; fixed with a
   **thread-safe magic-static one-time create** in `dllmain.cpp`. (b) controls were
   in a dynamically-created **TabBox/Page** that renders but doesn't route mouse
   input → flattened to **direct Screen children**. (c) `on_frame` gated on a stale
   `is_visible` → dropped that gate (poll whenever the handle exists). Slider
   internals (disasm-verified): value@0x218, max@0x220, thumb-scale@0x21c,
   thumb-off@0x224; `GetValue 0x895FE0`, `SetValue 0x8961B0`.

**2c world-collision pull-in (DONE, in `chase_cam.cpp`)** —
`/rcpchase collision on|off` (off by default). In the positioner, after computing
the wanted camera pos, cast pivot(playerXY@camZ)→wanted through world geometry and
pull the camera to the clamp point (×0.9 margin) on a hit. Uses the client's own LOS
primitive (all disasm-verified, coords are EQ-native **Y,X,Z**):
- `pCollision = *(void**)0x15D46B0` (SGraphicsEngine+0x14; vtable in eqgraphics.dll
  base ≥0x10000000 — guard on that before calling).
- Build info: `CCollisionInfoTargetVisibility` ctor **`0x8D4570`** `__thiscall(info,
  seg[6]={from.Y,from.X,from.Z,dY,dX,dZ}, excludeEntity=*(void**)0xDD2644, 0)`,
  ret $0xc; `info` = zeroed ≥0xA0-byte buffer.
- Test: `blocked = pCollision->vtable[0](pCollision, info)` (nonzero = blocked; or
  read `info+0x58`).
- Clamp point: **`0x7A2680`** `__thiscall(info, out[3])` → `out = start + t·dir`
  (Y,X,Z); `t` inits to 1.0 so out==wanted when clear.
- Ground-clamp fallback `CDisplay::GetFloorHeight 0x48C5B0`. Region (secondary):
  `pSceneGraph=*(void**)0x15D46A8`, `GetRegionNumber` = scenegraph vtable byte 0x48.

---

## Nameplate port (Zeal `nameplate.cpp` → RoF2) — ALL DONE (N1 tint, N2 text, N4 font/bars, N6 options)

### N4 FINAL render seam (confirmed working in-game, 2026-07-08)
The custom nameplates draw **inside the scene, pre-UI**, giving pixel-perfect UI occlusion + world
depth occlusion (same behavior as native name-sprites):
- `CRenderInterface::SetRenderCallback` (pRender=`*(void**)0x15D46A4`, vtable **index 50**/+0xC8) is
  registered as a **frame marker only** — disasm proved it fires at `0x10097733` inside
  `CRender::RenderScene` (0x10097420, vtable +0xa8) **BEFORE the world raster** (world/actor draws +
  particles follow it). Drawing there = world overdraws the text (invisible with z-write off) or
  z-fails behind the billboards' depth (fog-colored glyph blobs with z-write on).
- The actual draw is a **detour on `C2DPrimitiveManager::Render`** (EQGraphicsDX9.dll RVA 0xAE370,
  `__thiscall`, 2 dword args, ret 8; instance global 0x101B88B8; called twice per scene @0x10097817
  and @0x100978bb). On the FIRST call of a marked frame (flag from the render callback) the plates
  render: after all 3D (depth buffer = full world → wall occlusion), before the UI rasterizes
  (windows paint over plates). Install lazily from the EndScene callback once pRender exists; address
  computed as `GetModuleHandleA("EQGraphicsDX9.dll") + 0xAE370 - 0x10000000`.
- Device = `*(IDirect3DDevice9**)(pRender+0xF08)`. `bitmap_font.cpp` also unbinds vertex/pixel
  shaders + disables fog/alpha-test + fully specifies sampler state (mid-scene device state is dirty,
  unlike EndScene). DEAD ENDS (do not retry): EndScene draw (over UI), depth-mask of CXWndManager
  window rects (top-level list is ~777 flat entries incl. children — can't represent opaque UI),
  drawing at the SetRenderCallback itself (pre-world), DrawWindows-entry draws (2D path, discarded).
Lives in `src/nameplate.cpp` (the `/rcpnameplate` feature), a self-contained module in the
chase_cam.cpp style. Reference: `/home/joshua/workspace/GitHub/Zeal/Zeal/nameplate.cpp` (TAKP).

### Key architecture finding — RoF2 ≠ TAKP nameplate model
- In TAKP the nameplate ops were **`CDisplay` methods** taking an entity arg, and Zeal poked
  the color into a `StringSprite->Color` **data field**. In RoF2 they are **`PlayerClient`
  methods** (`this` == the entity) and color/text are applied through the entity's
  **actor-interface vtable**, not a data field.
- eqlib names them `PlayerClient::SetNameSpriteState/Tint`; addresses already match this build.

### Confirmed stock-RoF2 addresses (eqlib + disasm-verified)
- **`SetNameSpriteTint()` `0x58BF00`** — `__thiscall(this)`, no args, returns int (1 = tint
  applied). Guards `actor != 0` at entry; ends by `actor->vtable[+0x190](&color)` where
  `actor = *(void**)(entity+0x101c)` and `&color` points at the color bytes the client builds
  on its stack at `[esp+0xc..0xf]`. **Byte order is D3DCOLOR little-endian `B, G, R, A`**
  (`[+0xc]`=B, `[+0xd]`=G, `[+0xe]`=R, `[+0xf]`=A) — **confirmed in-game** (an initial R,G,B
  guess rendered a red con name as blue). So `apply_tint()` writes B,G,R,A.
- **`SetNameSpriteState(bool show)` `0x58E2D0`** (N2) — `__thiscall(this, show)`, `ret 0x4`.
  Sets text via `actor->vtable[+0x18c](0, 0, textPtr)`; `+0x1a4` = is-name-shown(bool).
  `bDisplayNameSprite @ entity+0x1228` gates it; race-hide uses `Animation @ entity+0x10c0`
  (values 0x10/0x21/0x26) and virtual `GetRace` (`[this]+0x88`).
- **Actor-interface `*(void**)(entity+0x101c)` vtable**: `+0x18c` set-string, `+0x190`
  set-tint(colorPtr), `+0x1a4` is-name-shown. Slot index = offset/4.

### RoF2 PlayerClient (Entity) offsets used (eqlib `PlayerClient.h`, disasm-confirmed)
`Type@0x125` (SPAWN_PLAYER=0, NPC=1, CORPSE=2 — RoF2 has one corpse type, unlike TAKP's
NPCCorpse/PlayerCorpse split), `Level@0x250` (u8), `Anon@0x2b8` (int; 1=anon, 2=roleplay,
tested as `>>1 & 1`), `PvPFlag@0x349` (u8), `GuildID@0x34c` (i32, -1 = unguilded),
`MasterID@0x38c` (pet owner spawn id, N2), `AFK@0x3c0` (int), `Linkdead@0x3d0` (u8),
`LFG@0x440` (u8), `Animation@0x10c0`. Globals: self `*(Entity**)0xDD2630`,
target `*(Entity**)0xDD2648`, controlled `0xDD2644`, CDisplay `0xDD2660`, CRaid `0xDD2690`.
**The vendored `game_functions`/`game_addresses` globals stay TAKP and are NOT used here** —
the module reads raw RoF2 offsets like chase_cam/mouse_mods.

### Status — N1 (tint), N2 (text), N6 (options window) all DONE/WORKING
Both detours off by default; each bails while its options are off (zero behavior change).
Our detour bodies run inside `rcp_guard::run(...)` (see crash-handler notes) so a stale
entity/actor degrades to a swallowed frame instead of crashing the client.

**N1 tint** — detour `0x58BF00`; when a coloring option is on, compute an `0xRRGGBB` and apply
via the actor vtable, return 1; else fall through to the original.
- **`concolors`** — con-level tint for players/NPCs. Level-band table reproduced locally from
  `Rcp::Game::GetLevelCon` (that fn routes through `get_user_color`/the unconstructed options
  UI, so it's unsafe to call here) → hardcoded con RGBs.
- **`colors`** — player state: PVP/AFK/LD/LFG/roleplay/guild(my/other/adventurer) + corpse.
  **Group & raid highlighting deferred to N1b** (needs the RoF2 group member list + `CRaid`);
  those players currently fall through to guild coloring.
- **`targetcolor`** / **`targetblink`** — highlight the target (`0xDD2648`), optional self-
  contained fade (own clock, GetTickCount).
- Colors are hardcoded defaults; wired to the options window in **N6**.

**N2 text** — detour the **actor's `vtable[+0x18c]`** set-string method (`__thiscall(actor, int
flag, char* text, char* scratch)`), whose address is read from a live actor
(`(*(void***)(*(void**)(entity+0x101c)))[0x18c/4]`) and hooked lazily in-game. **This is the
universal seam:** `SetNameSpriteState` calls it inline in the *normal* path (`0x58efe7`, args
`(0, &name, &scratch)`), and the `SetNameSpriteString 0x58BE90` wrapper calls it for the
*extended-nameplate* path. **Dead end that cost two rounds:** hooking `0x58BE90` catches only
extended mode — gated at `0x58E502` on `[0xD1FC34]!=0 && [*0xE67CCC+0x5c8]==1` — and stock RoF2
runs the normal path, so that hook never fired (log showed forced rebuilds but zero string
calls). Detouring the vtable function catches both modes. We map the `this` actor back to
self/target by comparing `*(void**)(entity+0x101c)`, and transform the text; other actors pass
through untouched, so the client's own name/title/guild formatting is preserved — no need to
reproduce Zeal's `generate_nameplate_text`.
**The two string params are not redundant:** the clear path (`0x58e319`) passes `(0, NULL, "")`
and the set path passes `(0, name, copyOfName)`. param2 = presence/identity (empty → sprite
removed — why hideself worked via param2 alone); **param3 = the text the renderer draws**, so
the transform must be written to BOTH params (markers were invisible while only param2 was
modified). Also: `SetNameSpriteState` early-outs at `0x58e2dd` unless `bDisplayNameSprite
(entity+0x1228)` is set — 0 for NPCs after spawn — so a forced rebuild must set it to 1 first
(self keeps 1, which made hideself work while target markers didn't).
- **`targetmarker`** — `>>Name<<` on the current target.
- **`targethealth`** — append ` NN%` on the target (`(HPCurrent@0x2e4 * 100)/HPMax@0x2dc`, or
  raw `HPCurrent` when max is 0, as for percent-only NPCs).
- **`hideself`** — blank your own nameplate (empty string) unless it's your target.
- **Deferred**: hide-raid-pets (needs raid list), show-pet-owner-name (needs a RoF2 spawn-id→
  entity lookup for the owner's name — vendored `EntityIdArray 0x78c47c` is TAKP), inline guild.

**Forced text rebuild (critical).** Unlike the tint (called every frame), the client only
rebuilds nameplate *text* on its own slow timer — NOT on targeting or HP change — so toggling a
text option or changing target had no visible effect. Fix: the tint hook (`0x58BF00`, per-frame
per-nameplate) also polls, and when our target/self/target-HP changes it **re-drives
`SetNameSpriteState 0x58E2D0`** (`__thiscall(this, bool show)`, `ret 0x4`) itself, which re-runs
our string+tint transforms immediately. `show` = the actor's own is-name-shown query
(`actor->vtable[+0x1a4](0)`) so we never conjure a nameplate the user turned off. A `g_refreshing`
guard stops the re-entrant tint call from recursing; the prior target gets one cleanup rebuild to
strip its marker on target change/deselect. (This is the RoF2 analog of Zeal's
`SetNameSpriteTint_UpdateState` RealRender promotion, done from the tint hook instead of by
patching the render call sites.)

### Nameplate roadmap (remaining) — N4 custom-font / bars overhaul (ONLY remaining nameplate work)
Draw our OWN nameplate text with a custom font and add **health / mana / stamina bars**
(+ optional drop shadows). Big infra lift, but the research below de-risks it substantially.

Already DONE (not remaining): group/raid coloring (N1b), name generation + extended shownames
(N3), options-window integration + color pickers (N6) — see the memory notes for their RE.
DROPPED from scope (per user): the `/tag` system (old N5) — no tag arrows.

#### RESOLVED: RoF2 is a **D3D9** client (settles the whole approach)
- Game dir ships BOTH `EQGfx_Dx8.dll` (imports `d3d8.dll`, LEGACY/dead) and
  **`EQGraphicsDX9.dll` (imports `d3d9.dll` + `d3dx9_30.dll`)** — the DX9 one is the live
  renderer. **`eqgame.exe` itself imports `d3dx9_30.dll`** (winedump-confirmed). The
  "eqgfx_dx8.dll" name in the vendored `callbacks.cpp` is TAKP-era and misleading — ignore it.
- Device is **`IDirect3DDevice9`** (eqlib `CRender`: `IDirect3D9* @0x0f04`, `IDirect3DDevice9*
  pD3DDevice @0x0f08`, err string "Direct3DCreate9 failed").
- **Why this is the easy path:** Zeal's font engine calls `D3DXCreateTexture`,
  `D3DXVec3Project`, `D3DXMatrix*` — all present in `d3dx9_30` with IDENTICAL signatures. The
  port is the mechanical D3D8→D3D9 delta below, NOT a rewrite of the font logic.

#### Zeal font architecture (source: `bitmap_font.*`, `nameplate.cpp`, `floating_damage.cpp`)
- Custom bitmap-atlas engine (`BitmapFontBase` + `BitmapFont` 2D / `SpriteFont` 3D), NOT
  `ID3DXFont`. Atlas = a MakeSpriteFont `.spritefont` binary (magic `"DXTKfont"`), DXT2
  texture via `D3DXCreateTexture`; embedded fallback `default_spritefont[]` (arial_8).
  Glyphs `glyph_table[128]`; own dynamic VB (FVF) + static IB, batched `DrawIndexedPrimitive`.
- **Nameplates = 3D billboard** (`SpriteFont`): hand the entity HEAD world-pos to the GPU;
  WORLD = scale(0.025) · transpose(view 3x3) · translate(headPos); z-buffer occludes it. **No
  explicit world-to-screen.** Head pos in TAKP = `entity->ActorInfo->DagHeadPoint->Position`
  (RoF2 equiv TBD — see AvatarHeight@0x138 / actor bounding-radius vtable in Phase-2 notes).
- **Floating damage = 2D** (`BitmapFont`): uses `DirectX::WorldToScreen` (`D3DXVec3Project` on
  the device's GetTransform WORLD/VIEW/PROJECTION + GetViewport), note EQ axis-swap x<->y.
- **Bars = special glyphs** `\x01`(bg) `\x02`(hp) `\x03`(mana) `\x04`(stam): appended to the
  string as control chars sampling an injected solid-white 4x4 texel block; fill width =
  pct·barWidth(120), height 6; HP color banded green/yellow/orange/red, mana blue, stam gold.
  Percents pushed via `set_hp/mana/stamina_percent` before `queue_string`.
- **Drop shadow / outline = re-queue** the same glyphs in near-black `XRGB(1,1,1)` at a small
  offset (outline = 2nd opposite offset); bars skip the shadow pass.

#### RoF2 render seam (source: our `directx.cpp` + eqlib graphics headers)
- **`src/directx.cpp` ALREADY has a correct D3D9 EndScene vtable hook** (throwaway-device trick:
  `Direct3DCreate9` → hidden HAL device → grab vtable **slot 42 = EndScene** → `swap_vtable_entry`
  in `src/hooks.cpp`). It's DORMANT only because **`directx::install()` is never called** —
  under DXVK all devices from the one `d3d9.dll` share a vtable, so this fires for the real device
  too. Activation = one guarded call from the `ProcessGameEvents_hk` magic-static (`dllmain.cpp`).
  This seam is **offset-independent** (doesn't need the uncertain game structs) → use it first.
- **`CallbackManager` (`src/callbacks.cpp`) is dead TAKP code** — unconstructed, all-TAKP
  addresses, its RenderUI hook even resolves the legacy `eqgfx_dx8.dll`. Do NOT wire it up.
- Cleaner device handle (optimization, later): `CRender* r = *(CRender**)0x15D46A4;` then
  `dev = *(IDirect3DDevice9**)((char*)r + 0xF08)`. **CAVEAT: eqlib tracks a NEWER build than our
  2013 exe** — the collision code already found disasm beats eqlib for `0x15D46A8/0x15D46B0`, so
  disasm-verify this pointer + `+0xF08` before trusting it. The EndScene trick avoids the risk.
- World-to-screen options: `CCameraInterface::ProjectWorldCoordinatesToScreen` (camera vtable
  ~slot 29 / +0x74, VERIFY slot on 2013 binary) OR manual `matrixViewProj` from `CRender+0x16c0`.
  Also `CDisplay::WriteTextHD2(text,x,y,color)` exists as a native screen-space writer.

#### D3D8→D3D9 code delta to apply when porting `bitmap_font.*` (from the Zeal audit)
- `SetVertexShader(FVF)` → **`SetFVF(FVF)`**; `SetStreamSource(0,vb,stride)` → add offset arg
  **`(0,vb,0,stride)`**; `SetIndices(ib,base)` → **`SetIndices(ib)`** (base dropped);
  `DrawIndexedPrimitive(...)` → **insert `BaseVertexIndex` as 2nd arg** (trickiest — the batch's
  start-vertex becomes BaseVertexIndex, MinIndex=0); `CreateVertexBuffer/IndexBuffer` → add
  trailing **`NULL`** (pSharedHandle); `Lock` ppbData `BYTE**`→**`void**`**; texture-stage
  **`D3DTSS_MINFILTER` → `SetSamplerState(0, D3DSAMP_MINFILTER, …)`** (COLOROP/ALPHAOP stay).
  Swap the bundled `d3dx8/` SDK for **d3dx9** headers/lib (`d3dx9_30`). Everything else (FVF
  flags, DXT2/INDEX16 formats, pools, lock flags, the −0.5 half-texel offset, billboard math,
  `D3DXVec3Project`) is unchanged D3D8↔D3D9.

#### N4 implementation plan (testable opt-in increments, off by default)
- **N4a — render seam: IMPLEMENTED + DEPLOYED, awaiting in-game log check.** `directx::install()`
  is now called once from the `ProcessGameEvents_hk` magic-static (`dllmain.cpp`). VERIFY in-game:
  `grep -E "directx::install|EndScene hook fired" /home/joshua/Games/RoF2/rof2ClientPlus.log`
  should show `install() -> OK` then periodic `EndScene hook fired, frame N`. No visible change.
  TODO after confirm: wrap `hkEndScene` body in `rcp_guard`; add `Reset`/device-lost handling.
  FOUNDATION — de-risks everything downstream, no game-offset dependency.
- **N4b — font engine: IMPLEMENTED + DEPLOYED, awaiting in-game test.** Ported `bitmap_font.{h,cpp}`
  + `default_spritefont.{cpp,h}` to D3D9 (self-contained; Zeal deps replaced with logger / a local
  split_text / a module-relative fonts dir / the RoF2 screen-res globals `0x00798564/8`). D3DX comes
  from MinGW's own `libd3dx9_30.a` + `<d3dx9.h>` (no vendoring needed; `-ld3dx9_30` in the Makefile) —
  matches the game's `d3dx9_30.dll`. Applied the full D3D8->D3D9 delta (SetFVF, +offset on
  SetStreamSource, SetIndices base dropped, `DrawIndexedPrimitive` BaseVertexIndex=0 inserted [our IB
  indices are ABSOLUTE so base stays 0], `Create*Buffer` +NULL, `Lock` void**, new `D3DSamplerStateStash`
  for `D3DSAMP_MINFILTER`). New `directx.cpp` render-callback list (invoked each EndScene, rcp_guard-
  wrapped) + `get_device()`. New `font_overlay.{h,cpp}` module (constructed in `rcp.cpp`) draws a 2D
  test string. VERIFY in-game: `/rcpfont test on` shows a yellow "rof2ClientPlus font test ..." string
  top-left; `off` removes it. (Embedded font is arial_8 — small; a bigger `.spritefont` in
  `<game>/uifiles/rcp/fonts/` can be loaded by name later.) TODO: device-lost `Reset` handling (VB/IB
  are D3DPOOL_DEFAULT); currently no `IDirect3DDevice9::Reset` hook.
- **N4c — nameplate integration: IN PROGRESS (3D billboards).** De-risk probe `/rcpfont test3d`
  CONFIRMED in-game. **RESOLVED:** (1) render-space head position = the entity's three world floats
  in MEMORY ORDER `(0x64,0x68,0x6c)` passed straight through, 0x6c vertical (+ `AvatarHeight@0x138`) —
  no axis swap; (2) world VIEW/PROJECTION are STILL LIVE at EndScene (2D UI uses XYZRHW, doesn't
  disturb them) so NO mid-frame matrix capture needed. Ship Zeal's `.spritefont` atlases
  (`uifiles/rcp/fonts/`, installed by the Makefile); load **`arial_bold_24` @ scale 0.025** (crisp;
  the embedded arial_8 upscaled looked blocky). **Placement:** anchor at head-top
  (`feet + AvatarHeight@0x138`) + a **screen-up (billboard-local) lift** `set_screen_offset` — NOT a
  world-Z offset (that collapses when viewed top-down). User-tuned default **1.8 line-heights**
  (`/rcpfont offset <lines>` live-tunes). A pixel-perfect match to the native plate isn't possible
  (native is 2D screen-projected) but it's moot once native is suppressed.
- **N4c v1 (tint-hook enumeration) — SUPERSEDED.** First cut reused the `SetNameSpriteTint 0x58BF00`
  hook to enumerate, but that hook fires per-frame only for **self + target** (they get continuous
  re-tint/highlight); other PCs/NPCs are tinted only occasionally, so only self+target drew. Also
  showed only `DisplayedName` (no title/last/guild), white (no con color), and empty self bars (spawn
  HP/mana/end fields are the *target/NPC* percent path — 0 for the local player).
- **N4c v2 DONE + DEPLOYED (spawn-list enumeration), awaiting in-game test.** `/rcpfont on|off`.
  Enumeration now WALKS THE SPAWN LIST directly each EndScene (research Q1, triple-confirmed):
  `mgr=*(void**)0xE641D0`, `first=*(void**)(mgr+0x08)`, `next=*(void**)(entity+0x08)`, NULL-term.
  Per entity: skip `Type@0x125==2` (corpse), require `actor@0x101c != 0`, distance-cull vs self
  (`g_np_max_dist`=300). Text + color REUSE nameplate.cpp via new `nameplate::billboard_text()`
  (generate_player_name for PCs → title/first/last/guild/AFK per /shownames; DisplayedName for NPCs)
  and `nameplate::billboard_color()` (state_color + con for NPCs + client-like default). HP bar: self
  from the **character profile** (Q5 — `pLocalPC=*(void**)0xDD261C`, czc=pc+0x2DC8; `Cur_HP 0x449E00`,
  `Max_HP 0x443FA0`, `Cur_Mana 0x4442E0`, `Max_Mana 0x581E60`, `Max_Endurance 0x582020`, cur-endurance
  = `*(int*)(profile+0x3390)`, profile via `GetCurrentProfile 0x7DB210(czc+0x0C)`); others from spawn
  `HPCurrent@0x2e4`/`HPMax@0x2dc` percent (drawn only when >0). Mana+stam bars self-only.
  **Refinements (all awaiting in-game test):**
  - **Anchor = model HEAD_NAME point (research-confirmed).** The native name sprite is attached (in
    EQGraphicsDX9.dll) to the model's `"HEAD_NAME"` skeletal point, which SCALES PER MODEL — so
    feet+`AvatarHeight@0x138` was "way off" for NPCs. The live world anchor is readable at
    `ss=*(actor+0x204)` (CStringSprite), pos `ss+0x6c/0x70/0x74` (0x74 vertical). font_overlay now
    reads that (fallback feet+AvatarHeight if `ss` is null pre-name). Native's own extra lift is
    `ss+0x60` (0 for HEAD_NAME, 1.55 else) added along camera-up — our `set_screen_offset` is the
    analog (default lowered to 0.5 lines now the anchor is the head, not the feet).
  - **Sizing = fixed world scale (shrinks with distance, like native).** Native is a WORLD billboard
    with a distance-compensated + CLAMPED scale (base 0.325 gfx units), NOT 2D screen text. A
    distance-compensation attempt (scale ∝ dist-to-camera for constant screen size) made far plates
    GIANT (bad camera read / euclidean-vs-depth), so REVERTED to a plain fixed world scale
    `g_np_scale`(0.04, `/rcpfont scale <n>`) that shrinks naturally with distance. SpriteFont has
    per-string scale support (`GlyphString.scale`) retained for later. TODO if wanted: native-style
    min/max screen-size clamp. `set_align_bottom(true)` so the plate grows UPWARD from the head anchor
    (adding HP/mana/stam bars no longer pushes the name down onto the head).
  - **Group coloring fix:** `is_group_member` now requires >=1 OTHER pc (the client keeps a stale solo
    group struct, which had colored your own plate as grouped).
  - **Native suppression DONE.** `nameplate::set_suppress_native(bool)` — when billboard mode is on,
    `transform_entity` returns "" for EVERY entity (blanks the native name via the set-string
    vtable+0x18c hook, which per research KEEPS the con-tint firing). font_overlay drives it on
    enable/disable. Native disappears within the client's own rebuild cycle (no forced rebuild yet).
  - **Persistence DONE.** `[Font]` ini section: `Billboard` (on/off), `Offset`, `Scale`. Loaded in
    the FontOverlay ctor (applies suppression to match), saved on every `/rcpfont` change and on the
    options-window toggle. Default scale is **0.032** (was 0.04; user asked for ~20% smaller).
  - **Options-window toggle DONE.** Standalone "Custom nameplates (3D font + bars)" checkbox on the
    Nameplate tab (`Rcp_NpBillboard`, generated by `tools/gen_rcp_options_ui.py`, wired in
    `rcp_options_ui.cpp` → `font_overlay::get_enabled`/`set_enabled`).
  **Still to do (N4d polish):** device-lost `Reset` handling (VB/IB are D3DPOOL_DEFAULT); optionally
  a native-style min/max size clamp, and persisting these to the options UI as sliders. Full
  name-sprite RE (CActor vtable 0x10137074, HEAD_NAME literal 0x10137c94, CStringSprite layout) is in
  the memory notes.
- **N4d — options + polish:** font pick, bar/shadow toggles on the Nameplate tab; ini persistence.

## Keybinds port (Zeal `binds.cpp` → RoF2) — DONE / WORKING
Lives in `src/keybinds.cpp` (the `/rcpbinds` feature), self-contained raw-RoF2 module. The
vendored `src/binds.cpp` is a TAKP reference only (its patch sites `0x52507A` etc. are TAKP)
and stays unconstructed.

### Key architecture finding — RoF2 ≠ TAKP bind-table model
- TAKP had a 128-name table with free index gaps and per-site hardcoded array refs that Zeal
  repointed to a 256-entry copy. **RoF2's `BindList` (`char*[479]` @ `0xACBEE8`, .data) is
  DENSE (0..478 all named)** and every key array is a fixed 500 slots — there is no room to
  append, and indices 479–499 are nameless internal dispatch ids (INSERT/CAMP/charselect…).
- **So we HIJACK dead commands instead**: the `CMD_REAL_ESTATE_*` block (429–446, the housing
  UI that doesn't exist on emu) → our binds get native ini persistence, native key capture,
  and native Options→Keys rows for free. We use **429–443**; 444–446 spare.
- The options Keys page only allows assignment for command ids **≤463** (`cmp eax,0x1CF` @
  `0x70ACCB`, the ONLY such check) — 429–443 is safely inside; nothing needed patching.

### Confirmed stock-RoF2 addresses (eqlib + disasm-verified)
- **`BindList` `0xACBEE8`** (`char*[479]`); count 479 (`0x1DF` bound at `0x4D71EA`).
  `GetMappableCommandName 0x4D7190`, `FindMappableCommand 0x4D71A0`.
- **`ExecuteCmd` `0x4D7230`** — `__cdecl(cmd, keydown, data, combo)`; keyboard sites push 3
  args, some UI sites 4 (forward all 4 in the detour). Gated on `g_eqCommandStates[500]` @
  `0xDCEF08` (0 = suppressed) — our detour mirrors that gate.
- **`KeypressHandler*` @ `0xE639B0`** (created by `0x55B2E0`, `new(0x1194)`): layout
  `KeyCombo NormalKey[500]` @+0, `AltKey[500]` @+0x7D0, `char CommandState[500]` @+0xFA0.
  `KeyCombo = {u8 Alt, u8 Ctrl, u8 Shift, u8 DIK}`; persisted int = `dik | alt<<28 |
  ctrl<<29 | shift<<30`. Methods: `HandleKeyDown 0x5594E0` (routes to CXWndManager first —
  typing protection comes free), `HandleKeyUp 0x559800`, `LoadAndSetKeymappings 0x55B100`,
  `ResetKeysToEqDefaults 0x5598D0` (reads `[Defaults] UseWASDDefault`), `SaveKeymapping
  0x55AC50` (ALL bind-change persistence funnels here — its only callers are the two Attach
  fns `0x55AFA0`/`0x55AFE0` + `MapKeyToEqCommand 0x55AD50`), `DeleteAllKeymappings 0x55B020`,
  `GetEqCommandSaveName 0x5596F0`. NOTE eqlib's two `Attach*` defines are swapped for this
  build (0x55AFA0 = primary/`_1`, 0x55AFE0 = alternate/`_2`).
- **Persistence**: `eqclient.ini` `[KeyMaps]`, key `KEYMAPPING_<BINDLISTNAME>_<1|2>`, decimal
  combo int; global per install; written only on change.
- **Options window**: `COptionsWnd*` @ `0xD1FC6C`, object size 0x1378, ctor `0x70AFF0`.
  `InitKeyboardAssignments 0x7046C0` (giant, ~421 inlined adds: `CStringTable::GetString
  0x7D0660` on instance `[0xDD25C4]` → `CXStr::operator=(char*) 0x805DE0` → category int)
  fills the `{CXStr desc, int category}` stride-8 array @ **this+0x40C** (capacity exactly
  479; eqlib's `Binds[0xA1]`@0x228 is stale). Real-estate ids 429–432 natively get category
  0x40/UI labels, 434–445 get 0x40000/Item Placement, 433+446 get none — all overwritten by
  our detour. `RefreshCurrentKeyboardAssignmentList 0x70A560` (`__thiscall`, no args)
  repaints the list; the client itself calls it via `[0xD1FC6C]` (e.g. at `0x5FD10F`).
  **Categories are BITMASKS** (filter choice i = bit i): Movement 0x1, Commands 0x2, Spell
  0x4, Target 0x8, Camera 0x10, Chat 0x20, UI 0x40, Hotbar1..10 0x80..0x10000, VoiceChat
  0x20000, ItemPlacement 0x40000, "All" = 0x7FFFF.
- **Merchant stack buy/sell**: `CMerchantWnd*` @ `0xD1FCA4` (size 0x2B0); selected slot
  `ItemGlobalIndex.Location` @+0x23C (**9 = merchant side → buy, 0 = possessions → sell**),
  `pSelectedItem` @+0x248; active merchant entity @ `0xDD264C`. `HandleBuy 0x6F2620` /
  `HandleSell 0x6F29C0` (`__thiscall(int qty)`, −1 = quantity flow) → `CQuantityWnd::Open
  0x725B00` reads **`CXWndManager` (`[0x15D3D00]`) shift byte @+0x9D** and with shift set
  commits the max quantity synchronously without showing the dialog → `WndNotification`
  msg 0x24 → PurchasePageHandler `RequestGetItem 0x6F5BE0` / `RequestPutItem 0x6F6650`.
  So the bind fakes shift around `HandleBuy/-Sell(−1)` — the client computes the full stack
  (min of stock & stack size / current stack count) and runs its own money/space checks.
- **Slash commands confirmed in the command table** (`__CommandList 0xACD5A8`, stride 0x1C):
  `/autoinventory` (handler `0x4FE8C0`), `/autofire` (`0x4FB9B0`), `/pet` (`0x4E2150`),
  `/loot` (`0x4E7880`), `/assist`. RoF2 `/pet` subcommand vocabulary (string table @ file
  offset 0x5f3514): attack, qattack, back off/back, follow, guard, sit, hold, ghold,
  spellhold, taunt, regroup, stop, focus, feign, leave, get lost, health/report health,
  leader/who leader.

### What was OMITTED because stock RoF2 already has it (user rule: skip native features)
Strafe (`STRAFE_LEFT/RIGHT` 6/7), tab-target cycling (`CYCLENPCTARGETS` 33 +
`TARGET_PREV/NEXT_NPC` 474/475), PC cycling (31), **corpse target/cycle (34/35)**, map
toggle (`TOGGLE_MAPWIN` 338), reply target (`RTARGET` 317), toggle-last-two-targets (343),
open/close/toggle all bags (379–381), camera selects (345–350), 10 native hotbar pages,
stop-cast (370). Zeal's map/tellwindow/slowturn/rangeattack/page-10 binds don't apply (no
such modules here / native equivalents); deferred: single-shot Range Attack, slow-turn.

### Status — DONE / WORKING; all detours act only on hijacked ids
- **14 new binds** (ids 429–443): Pet Attack/Back Off/Follow/Guard/Sit/Health/Hold (forward
  `/pet …`), Auto Fire (`/autofire`), Auto Inventory (`/autoinventory`), Buy/Sell Stack
  (merchant fake-shift), Assist (`/assist`), Toggle Nameplate Colors / Con Colors / Hide
  Self (drive `nameplate_settings`), Loot Target (`/loot`). Set them in the STOCK Options →
  Keys tab (categories Commands/Target/UI).
- Detours: `ExecuteCmd` (dispatch + swallow), `InitKeyboardAssignments` (labels+categories),
  `SaveKeymapping` + `DeleteAllKeymappings` (per-char redirection). Constructor repoints
  `BindList[429..443]`, zeroes any stale real-estate combos the boot-time load left in those
  slots, then re-drives `LoadAndSetKeymappings` so saved `KEYMAPPING_RCP_*` keys apply.
- **Per-character keybinds** (`/rcpbinds perchar on|off`, `[Binds] PerCharacter` in
  rof2ClientPlus.ini): a `[KeyMaps_<CharName>]` overlay section in eqclient.ini. On world
  entry / char switch (frame poll): ResetKeysToEqDefaults → LoadAndSetKeymappings (global)
  → overlay. Options-window key changes while ON are redirected to the char section; the
  Keys-page "Reload defaults" wipes only the char section (global stays) and re-syncs to
  global next frame. `/rcpbinds list|reload` for inspection.

---

## Crash + windowed-start diagnostics (`src/crash_handler.*`, `src/window_watch.*`) — DONE (windowed launch FIXED; crash handler armed)
Added to chase the report: *"after the client crashes, a WindowedMode=TRUE relaunch flashes
the window open then hides it (not on the taskbar), the process lingers, and it self-heals
after a while; fullscreen always works."* Environment: **wine-staging 11.12 + DXVK (Vulkan)
d3d9 on NVIDIA, presented through XWayland under KWin**, no Wine virtual desktop.

### FINAL diagnosis (verified live, fix shipped) — the window gets UNMAPPED; the game is fine
Two earlier theories died on the evidence ("leftover eqgame holds GPU/wineserver" — disproven by a
clean-state repro; "windowed-init livelock" — disproven by `Logs/dbg.txt`). The truth:

- **In windowed mode the game runs perfectly** — `Logs/dbg.txt` (the client's own init journal,
  ALWAYS check this first) shows device init, fonts, strings, UI, all the way to the **login
  screen** (`eqlsUIConfig.ini loaded`), rendering ~200 fps. What I'd read as a "livelock" in the
  `+x11drv` trace was simply the login screen presenting frames.
- **The X11 window gets UNMAPPED shortly after creation** (and was parked at +946+1473, outside
  the visible area of the 2560×1440 monitor; X span is 6066×2880 multi-monitor). KWin drops
  unmapped windows from management → no taskbar entry, no alt-tab → "flashes open then hides,
  process remains". Verified with a raw-X probe: `state=UNMAPPED override_redirect=0`.
- **One `XMapRaised` fixes it**: KWin re-adopts the window (appears in `workspace.windowList()`,
  activates, behaves like any native window). Verified end-to-end through `launch-eq.sh`.
- Environment-independent within this stack: repro'd under wine-staging 11.12 **and** GE-Proton11,
  DXVK **and** WineD3D, any window size — the unmap is a Wine↔KWin/XWayland launch race, not a
  runtime version issue. gamescope also works (game window lives in gamescope's own nested
  Xwayland, no KWin management involved) — kept as `launch-eq-gamescope.sh` plan B.

**Why every in-`.asi` diagnostic missed it:** the `.asi` loads via Miles at sound init, and a
hidden/never-focused client doesn't get that far audibly (plus the test-harness shells never
attach the `.asi` at all — even fullscreen — so **PROCESS_ATTACH is NOT a valid progress signal
from scripted shells; use `Logs/dbg.txt`**). In the user's own sessions the mod attaches ~8s in.

**The fix — `tools/eq_window_fix.c` → `eq-window-fix` (host gcc + libX11, built by `make`,
installed by `make install`):** a per-launch watcher (started by `launch-eq.sh`, 120 s) that scans
ALL top-level `eqgame` class windows (skipping Wine's 1×1 override-redirect IME helpers) and
re-maps + activates any UNMAPPED one (respecting `WM_STATE=IconicState` so user-minimized clients
stay minimized), and re-centers any window parked fully outside the X span. Idempotent; multiple
concurrent instances are harmless. Log: `eq-window-fix.log` (appended) in the game dir.

**MULTI-BOX CONSTRAINT (user requirement):** multiple simultaneous eqgame.exe clients are a
supported workflow. **Never blanket-`pkill eqgame.exe` and never run `wineserver -k` in any
automation** — both kill every boxed character. The launchers only do that under an explicit
`--clean` flag; the watcher fixes every client's window and touches nothing else. Recovery for a
single wedged client: `pgrep -af eqgame.exe` → `kill -9 <that pid>`.

### `crash_handler.*` — post-mortem + a MinGW-safe detour guard
- **`crash_handler::install()`** (called first in `dllmain on_attach`): `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter`
  (full dump: exception code, faulting **module+offset** — flags our own `.asi` — access r/w+addr,
  registers, 16 bytes @ EIP, `StackWalk64` via **dbghelp** with an EBP-chain fallback) +
  `AddVectoredExceptionHandler(1,…)` used **only** for guard recovery so the game's own SEH is
  never disturbed. Logger flushes per line, so the dump survives an immediate exit. Needs
  `-ldbghelp` (Makefile) / `dbghelp.lib;psapi.lib` (vcxproj).
- **`rcp_guard::run(name, lambda)`** — GCC/mingw does **NOT** implement MSVC `__try/__except`
  (verified: `i686-w64-mingw32-g++` rejects it), so crash containment for our detours is built
  from `setjmp` + a thread-local guard-frame stack; the vectored handler `longjmp`s back **only
  on `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` while a guard is armed**. Guarded bodies must be POD-only (the
  long jump abandons the frame without running destructors). Wraps the POD bodies of the
  nameplate tint (`0x58BF00`), chase Cam6 positioner (`0x799140`, incl. the eqgraphics collision
  call), and mouse `GetDeviceState` turn. Master switch `[Window] GuardDetours` (default **on**);
  `/rcpwindow guard on|off`. Caveat: the VEH precedes frame-based SEH, so guarding a body that
  calls into game code that *intentionally* AV-and-handles could steal it — those features are
  opt-in, so containment > that small risk; disable per-feature via the toggle if needed.

### `window_watch.*` — windowed-start diagnostics + opt-in self-heal (`/rcpwindow`, `[Window]`)
Driven from `ProcessGameEvents_hk` (the EndScene hook in `directx.cpp` is **dormant** — never
installed in the foundation subset — so health logging runs on the main loop instead).
- **`install_early()`** (on_attach): logs `DISPLAY`, the `eqclient.ini` window keys
  (`WindowedMode`/`Maximized`/`WindowedWidth×Height`/`WindowedMode{X,Y}Offset`), and a **Toolhelp
  scan for leftover sibling `eqgame.exe`** — the prime suspect, logged loudly at every startup.
- **`on_frame()`**: finds the main window via **`EnumWindows`-by-PID** (this build ships **no
  `eqw.dll`**, so `get_game_window()` is null), subclasses its WndProc to log
  activate/show/size/focus/destroy, and emits a per-frame health line
  (`vis/icon/fg/loop=<mainloop count>/rect vs monitor`) — dense for ~20 s then on state-change.
  `loop` climbing while `vis=0` ⇒ "alive but hidden"; `fg=0` persisting ⇒ never got foreground.
- **Opt-in self-heal** (`[Window] SelfHeal`, default **off**; `/rcpwindow on`): for the window's
  first ~8 s, if hidden/iconic/unfocused, `clamp on-screen + SW_RESTORE/SW_SHOW +
  BringWindowToTop + SetForegroundWindow` (≤4×/s). **Only helps if the client reached its main
  loop** — the pre-`.asi` hang above is out of reach.
- Commands: `/rcpwindow [on|off]` (self-heal), `guard on|off`, `verbose on|off`, `heal`, `info`.

**Status:** windowed launch FIXED via `eq-window-fix` (see FINAL diagnosis above) — verified
end-to-end through `launch-eq.sh` (window re-mapped at t+9s, KWin-managed, login screen live).
The `window_watch` module's self-heal can't address the launch-time unmap (the `.asi` loads too
late) — it stays as an in-game diagnostic; the `crash_handler` half remains the tool for the
other original complaint, genuine *in-game* crashes: the next real crash writes a module+offset
post-mortem to `rof2ClientPlus.log`. If the window ever lands awkwardly on the multi-monitor
span (dead zones between mixed-size monitors), extend `eq_window_fix.c` with RandR per-monitor
placement.

## Distance-fog removal (`src/no_fog.cpp`, `/rcpfog`) — DONE (awaiting in-game confirm)

Goal: zero distance fog in every zone, day and night.

### Key finding — the TAKP fog interface does NOT port
The Zeal/TAKP `CDisplay::SetFog` (0x004add26), `SetYon` (0x004aca7f), `SetDayPeriod`
(0x004b177f) and `GAMEZONEINFO @ 0x00798784` in `game_structures.h` / `game_addresses.h` are
**stale TAKP addresses** — all decode to garbage in the RoF2 `eqgame.exe` and are referenced by
nothing. In RoF2 the zone header is a **heap object** (`new(0x23c)`, e.g. the allocs at 0x497fdc /
0x49ac16 / 0x645c59 → 0x8dbb3b), not a fixed global, so the Zeal char-select trick
(`ZoneInfo->0x184/0x194 = big; SetYon(big)`) has no fixed address to poke. The real fog-colour
setup lives around 0x4ad960–0x4adea0 (writes fog RGB to `ds:0xdcecd4/d8/dc`, init-flag `0xdcece0`),
but hooking it was unnecessary.

### Mechanism — device-level D3DRS_FOGENABLE filter (zone-layout independent)
RoF2 distance fog is **fixed-function D3D fog** gated by `D3DRS_FOGENABLE` — proven inside this mod:
`bitmap_font.cpp:816` disables that exact state so world-pass glyphs aren't "greyed out by depth".
So `no_fog.cpp` hooks the shared DXVK `IDirect3DDevice9::SetRenderState` (vtable **slot 57**; EndScene
at 42 in `directx.cpp` fixes the standard layout) and forces `D3DRS_FOGENABLE → FALSE`. The client
re-issues fog-enable every frame, so a persistent filter covers all zones + day/night with no
re-hooking; the `/rcpfog` toggle just flips a bool. Install mirrors `mouse_mods` (capture original
from the slot BEFORE `hooks->Add(..., hook_type_vtable)`, call it directly on the hot path — no
hook-map lookup). Installed lazily on the first `directx::add_render_callback` device (the shared
vtable is the same one `directx.cpp` already patched for EndScene).

`/rcpfog on` removes fog (default ON), `off` restores client default, bare toggles; persisted to
`[Fog] RemoveDistanceFog` in `rof2ClientPlus.ini`. Caveat: also removes underwater fog haze (same
FOGENABLE gate) — toggle off if that's unwanted. **Confirmed working in-game 2026-07-08.**

Also exposed in `/rcpoptions` as a **new "Display" tab** (checkbox "Remove distance fog", ScreenID
`Rcp_NoFog`): `no_fog.h` publishes a `no_fog_settings` namespace (`get_enabled`/`set_enabled`), the
UI binds/polls it like the other toggles, and the tab strip grew 4→5 (window widened 280→356 to keep
the proven 64 px tab width — see `tools/gen_rcp_options_ui.py`). Regenerate order unchanged:
`gen_option_overrides.py` then `gen_rcp_options_ui.py`.

## Target ring (`src/target_ring.cpp`, `/rcpring`) — DONE (awaiting in-game confirm)

Goal: a **solid-color "donut" ring** drawn flat on the ground under the current target, with
user-settable color (stock color picker), outer radius, inner radius (the donut hole), and opacity.
Zeal reference: `/home/joshua/workspace/GitHub/Zeal/Zeal/target_ring.cpp` (TAKP, D3D8).

### What it is (a slim subset of Zeal's target_ring)
Zeal's ring supports textures, spin, a 3-D cone/cylinder, auto-attack blink, and heading-match. The
cone and auto-attack blink are **intentionally dropped**, but the **optional graphic (texture)** plus
**spin / face-heading** were added back (see "Ring graphic" and "Spin" below). Kept: enable, RGB color
OR **con-level color** (toggle), outer radius, inner radius, opacity, hide-under-self, an optional
graphic, and spin-vs-face-heading. `/rcpring [on|off | outer N | inner N | opacity 0-1 | color RRGGBB
| con on|off | self on|off | graphic <name>|none | spin on|off]`; bare `/rcpring` toggles. Persisted
to `[TargetRing]` (`Color` stored as `RRGGBB` hex, like `[NameplateColors]`; `ConColor` the
con-vs-fixed toggle; `Graphic` the texture name or `None`; `Spin` the spin toggle). Off by default.

**Con coloring** (Zeal's `target_color` toggle): when on, the ring is colored by the target's con
level instead of the fixed color, via a new `nameplate::con_color_for(entity)` export that ALWAYS
computes the con color (independent of the nameplate con-colors setting) from the same level-band
table + user-editable con palette (Colors tab). Setting a fixed color (command `color`, or the swatch
picker) flips con off so the choice is visible.

### Vertical placement — floor Z, NOT the entity position ref
The entity `Z@0x6c` is a POSITION REFERENCE that floats above the model's feet (same quirk the N4
billboards hit: "feet+AvatarHeight was way off for NPCs"), so drawing there made the ring hover. The
native ring sits on the floor, so the vertical uses **`FloorHeight@0x28`** (eqlib `PlayerBase`; that
struct matches our build at `0x28/0x64/0x68/0x6c/0x80/0x125/0x138`) — the client's own absolute floor
Z under the entity — guarded (nonzero, and `posZ - floorZ` within `[-10, 60]`) with a fallback to
`0x6c`. Horizontal center stays `0x64/0x68`. A one-shot `[ring] Z:` log (first ~5 frames after
enable) records `pos/floor/drop/chosen` for diagnosis.

### Render seam — REUSES the nameplate billboards' pre-UI in-scene seam (not a new hook)
A ground ring wants exactly the seam the N4 billboards already solved: **after the world raster**
(so it z-tests against terrain/walls and is occluded by geometry in front) and **before the UI
raster** (so windows paint over it). That seam is the `C2DPrimitiveManager::Render` detour in
`font_overlay.cpp`. Rather than add a second detour on the same address (conflict) or draw at
EndScene (post-UI → draws over windows), `font_overlay` now exposes
**`font_overlay::add_scene_draw(cb)`**: extra world-space overlays are invoked right after
`on_render_nameplates`, inside the same marked-frame block, each `rcp_guard`-wrapped. It installs
whenever `FontOverlay` exists — independent of whether billboard nameplates are enabled. `TargetRing`
registers its draw there in its ctor.

### Geometry + coordinate mapping (trivial for a circle)
- Target = `*(void**)0xDD2648`; self = `0xDD2630`. Feet/ground position = entity floats
  `0x64/0x68/0x6c` in **memory order**, `0x6c` the vertical — **the same three floats the billboards
  translate `D3DTS_WORLD` by** (confirmed working), so the ring center lands exactly where the native
  plate anchors. A circle is rotationally symmetric, so the EQ X/Y ordering is irrelevant: generate
  it in the render horizontal plane (vary the first two render coords, hold `0x6c`) and it lies flat.
- Donut = one closed **triangle strip**: at each of `kNumSegments`(96)+1 angles emit an outer-rim then
  an inner-rim vertex; the strip stitches successive pairs into the band's quads. Built around the
  origin, translated to the target's feet via a hand-built `D3DMATRIX` (`_41/_42/_43`), lifted
  `+0.20` to avoid z-fighting the ground; **VIEW/PROJECTION stay live** from the world pass.

### D3D9 draw (same mid-scene hygiene as the 3-D billboards, minus the atlas)
Fixed-function `D3DFVF_XYZ | D3DFVF_DIFFUSE | D3DFVF_TEX1` (the UVs are only consumed by the graphic
path; the solid path ignores them), drawn with **`DrawPrimitiveUP`** (no vertex-buffer lifecycle /
device-lost handling). Unbind vertex+pixel shaders (a bound PS overrides fixed-function), then via the
shared `D3DRenderStateStash`/`D3DTextureStateStash` (in `bitmap_font.h`): `CULLMODE=NONE`, alpha-blend
`SRCALPHA/INVSRCALPHA`, `ZENABLE=TRUE` (terrain occlusion), `ZWRITEENABLE=FALSE` (translucent, no
depth write), `LIGHTING/ALPHATEST/FOG/SPECULAR` off, stage 1 disabled. Solid mode: stage-0
`COLOROP/ALPHAOP = SELECTARG1(DIFFUSE)` + no texture. Restore all of it (incl. WORLD + shaders) after
the draw. `alpha = opacity*255` in the ARGB diffuse.

### Ring graphic (the one Zeal extra added back)
`/rcpring graphic <name>` (or the "Cycle graphic" button on the Ring tab) selects a **`.tga` from
`uifiles/rcp/targetrings`** (bare `/rcpring graphic` lists what's on disk; `none` clears it). Loaded
with **`D3DXCreateTextureFromFileA`** (defaults to `D3DPOOL_MANAGED`, so it survives device resets —
no reset hook needed) **deferred to the render thread**: the setter only assigns `g_graphic` + sets a
dirty flag, and `draw_ring` does the create/release the next frame against the live device (inside
`rcp_guard`). Failure logs once and falls back to the solid ring.

Mapping is **identical to Zeal** so its own ring textures render unchanged: Zeal ships 261×2048 RGBA
"strip" textures (u = inner..outer across the band width, v = around the circumference), and the donut
UVs are `u = 1` on the outer rim / `0` on the inner rim, `v = 1 - i/segments`. Stage-0 is
`MODULATE(TEXTURE, DIFFUSE)` for **both color and alpha** (like Zeal), so the ring color/con-color
tints the texture (white ⇒ the texture's native colors) and opacity scales its alpha; sampler set to
`LINEAR`, `ADDRESSU=CLAMP` (radial), `ADDRESSV=WRAP` (seamless around). When a graphic is active we
draw **only** the textured donut (no solid pass behind it — cleaner than Zeal's solid+texture stack).
A curated set of Zeal's ring `.tga`s ships in `uifiles/rcp/targetrings` (`make install` copies them);
users can drop in their own.

### Spin / face-heading (`/rcpring spin on|off`, `Rcp_RingSpin` checkbox)
The ring rotates about its vertical axis (local Z, the ring's normal) via the WORLD matrix's upper-left
2×2 — no vertex regen, and invisible on a solid ring (symmetric), so it only shows on a graphic. Two
modes on one toggle (default **on**): **spin** = a slow continuous rotation (`rot = -g_spin_angle`, one
revolution every `kSpinPeriodSec` = 8 s; the accumulator + `GetTickCount64` delta live on the render
thread, with the delta capped at 100 ms so an alt-tab/zone stall doesn't lurch it, and reset to 0
whenever spin is off so re-enabling doesn't jump); **face-heading** (spin off) =
`rot = Heading@0x80 * (PI/256) + g_face_offset_deg*(PI/180)`, i.e. the graphic is oriented to the way
the target faces. `Heading` is a `float 0..512` (eqlib PlayerClient, same struct as the pos fields;
`Heading@0x80` is the logical heading and it *does* update during movement — an earlier detour through
the render actor's `GetHeading()` proved identical and was reverted). The `+PI/256` sign was confirmed
in-game (the initial `-PI/256` was backwards). `/rcpring faceoffset <deg>` (`[TargetRing] FaceOffset`,
default 0) fine-aligns a texture's "front" — 0 works for DarkMode.

**Self-target caveat (inherent, not a bug):** when the target is *you*, turning rotates your camera
with the ring, so its rotation cancels on screen and it looks static — it's correctly pointing where
you face (always "into the screen"). NPC / other-player targets turn independently of your camera, so
the ring visibly tracks them — that's the useful case. (This chewed several debug rounds: a temporary
bright-yellow front pointer + a self-vs-NPC diagnostic log finally isolated it to a reversed sign, both
since removed.)

### Ring-tab dropdown — a real native `Combobox` (`Rcp_RingGraphic`)
The Ring-tab picker is a native **`CComboWnd`** (same widget Zeal used for this exact feature). Earlier
notes warned a runtime-instantiated `TabBox` doesn't route input — but that's specific to the
page-managing TabBox; the plain Button/Slider/Label children of our runtime-instantiated `RcpOptions`
already route input fine, and a combobox is self-contained (it owns its popup `CListWnd` at
`+0x1d8`). The combo is driven **entirely by polling**, exactly like the sliders/checkboxes — no
`WndNotification` subclass needed, since our screen uses the stock `CSidlScreenWnd` vtable:
`populate_graphic_combo()` (on create + every open) does `CComboWnd::DeleteAll (0x86A960)` then
`InsertChoice (0x86AE50)` for `get_available_graphics()` ("None" + each `.tga` stem), caches that
index→name list in `graphic_choices_`, and `SetChoice (0x86A740)` to the persisted graphic;
`on_frame` polls `GetCurChoice (0x86A780)` and, on a changed index, maps it back through
`graphic_choices_` and calls `set_graphic`. SIDL is the stock combobox schema (`WDT_Inner` /
`BDT_Combo` / `Style_Border` / `ListHeight` / `Choices`, matching `BUGW_BugTypes`); `InsertChoice`
takes a `const CXStr&` so we build one with `cxstr_init` and release it with `kCXStrDtor` (same as
`set_label_text`). Offsets verified against the locally-cloned eqlib whose
`CreateXWnd/GetChildItem/slider/color-picker` addresses all match this build. The window grew
`356 → 400` tall so the drop list (bottom ~388) sits inside the window.

### Options window — new "Ring" tab (tab index 5)
Tab strip grew 5→6 (window widened 356→**424** to keep the 64 px tab width; tab-5 right edge 411).
Controls (ScreenIDs `Rcp_Ring*`): enable checkbox, **hide-under-self** checkbox, a **color swatch**
button (its text tinted the live ring color; click opens the stock `CColorPickerWnd`), and outer /
inner / opacity sliders with value labels. The ring color is the ring's **own** setting (not a
nameplate role): the picker reuses the existing machinery via a sentinel `picker_role_ ==
kRingColorRole (100)` that `open_color_picker` + the picker-poll branch on. `kTabCount` 5→6 in
`rcp_options_ui.h`; the rest is the standard bind/sync/poll/show-hide pattern. Radius sliders map
0..60 → 0..`radius_max()`(30) world units; opacity 0..100 → 0..1. Regenerate order unchanged:
`gen_option_overrides.py` then `gen_rcp_options_ui.py`.

Caveat (inherited from Zeal): the ring is a **flat disc** at the floor Z under the target, so on
steep slopes / stairs it clips into or floats over the terrain — Zeal tried per-vertex
world-collision height and abandoned it as worse. Built + installed; floor-Z placement + con-color
toggle added 2026-07-09; **optional ring graphic (texture) added 2026-07-09** — awaiting in-game
confirm.

## View distance / far clip (`src/view_distance.cpp`, `/rcpviewdist`) — DONE (confirmed in-game 2026-07-09)

Goal: extend the world/terrain view distance far past the stock "Clip Plane" slider cap, up to
seeing the whole zone. Fog (the soft view wall) was already removed by `no_fog.cpp`; this raises the
hard geometry far clip.

### Key finding — the stock "ClipPlane" integer is NOT a live knob (it mostly drives fog)
The options "Clip Plane" slider maps to an int at `ds:0x00DE0C00` (ini `[Options] ClipPlane`, min 20,
`FogScale @ 0x00DE0D34 = ClipPlane*0.2` clamped [0.1,4.0]). **Poking that int does nothing visible** —
it feeds fog (the routine at `0x48afa7` writes fog RGB bytes to `[cam+0x140..142]`) and an
event-driven camera path, but the projection is never rebuilt from it per frame. The real far clip
lives on the **render camera**: `*(void**)0x00DD2660` is the camera/view object, **`camera+0x8`**
(float) is the far clip distance, handed to the graphics-engine camera sub-object `*(camera+0x118)`
via its **vtbl `+0x0c`** when the projection is rebuilt by `0x0048F290` (which also sets
near=`camera+0x2900`→vtbl `+0x04` and FOV via `fptan`/`fpatan`; the giveaway is the nearby string
`"Camera Aspect Ratio is now %f. (NORM = 1.25. Use 10000 to reset)"`). The setter
**`0x004940A0(camera, float dist)`** does `camera+0x8 = dist; call 0x48F290(camera)` — exactly what the
slider calls. `camera+0x8` is written by only 4 event sites (slider `0x709c95`, settings-apply
`0x4d87d9`/`0x4d88b6`, zone-load `0x53ac1d`), **never per frame**, which is why a source poke never
rebuilds. There is no upper clamp in this path; distant terrain IS submitted (no BSP/LOD wall) and no
engine far-plane cap was hit at 12000 units.

### Mechanism — call the client's own camera-clip setter, re-assert on drift
`view_distance.cpp` registers a `directx::add_render_callback` (EndScene). When enabled it does a
drift check — if `fabs(*(float*)(camera+0x8) - target) > 0.5` it calls `0x004940A0(camera, target)` to
set the far clip and rebuild the projection. Normally that's a single float compare with no client
call; the drift path self-heals after a zone reset (which restores the stock distance via `0x53ac1d`).
Guards: `camera = *(void**)0xDD2660` non-null AND `*(camera+0x118)` non-null (0x48F290 dereferences
`+0x118` without a null check), so it's a no-op off-scene (char select / loading). It captures the
stock `camera+0x8` once so `/rcpviewdist off` restores it.

`/rcpviewdist <n>` forces the far clip to **n world units** (higher = farther; direct distance, not
the slider's lerp), `/rcpviewdist off` restores the client default, bare `/rcpviewdist` prints status
including the **live far clip** (read the stock baseline, then set above it). Persisted to
`[ViewDistance] FarClip`/`ActorClip` in `rof2ClientPlus.ini`; default OFF. **Confirmed in-game
2026-07-09: `/rcpviewdist 12000` renders the whole zone.**

### Actors — `/rcpactordist` (confirmed in-game 2026-07-09)
Actors (NPCs/players) use a **separate** field on the same camera object: **`camera+0x2d78`** (int),
whose engine distance is `int*10 + 50` (stock `0x32`=50 → 550 world units, why mobs pop in close). It
is fed to the graphics camera via vtbl `+0x14` during the same `0x48F290` rebuild (load ~`0x491e69`
"ActorClipPlane" → `[edi+0x2d78]`, save ~`0x615662`). `view_distance.cpp` drives terrain + actors
through one `apply()`+rebuild; `/rcpactordist <n>` takes world units and converts `int=(n-50)/10`.
**Shadows are `camera+0x2d7c` (vtbl `+0x1c`) — deliberately never touched.**

### Display-tab UI (two sliders, done)
Added to the `/rcpoptions` Display tab (NOT the stock options sliders): **Rcp_FarClip** (terrain) and
**Rcp_ActorClip** (actors), each 0..200 steps → 0..20000 world units (100/step; raw 0 = OFF), with a
"off"/value label. Standard bind/sync/poll/show-hide pattern (mirrors `Rcp_NpDist`); the poll calls
`view_distance_settings::set_clip` / `set_actor_clip`. Regenerate order unchanged:
`gen_option_overrides.py` then `gen_rcp_options_ui.py` (81 controls now). Full RE trail in the
`view-distance-re` memory.

## GOTCHA: the vendored `game_functions` / `game_ui` / `game_structures` layer is STALE TAKP
`src/game_functions.cpp`, `src/game_ui.h`, `src/game_structures.h`, `src/game_addresses.h` were vendored
verbatim from Zeal and **still hold TAKP (Mac-client) addresses/offsets — they are NOT repointed to our
RoF2 `eqgame.exe`.** They are byte-identical to Zeal's originals (e.g. `can_use_item`@0x4BB8E8,
`can_item_equip_in_slot`@0x4F0DB4, `get_char_info`@0x7F94E8, `InvSlot::HandleLButtonUp`@0x421E48,
`CInvSlotMgr::FindInvSlot`@0x423010, `InvSlotWnd::HandleRButtonUp`@0x5a7e80). Disassembling any of them in
our binary shows mid-function/garbage, not a clean prologue — e.g. 0x5a7e80 is the inner loop of a
vector-copy routine at 0x5a7e50, so hooking it corrupts code.

**Every WORKING RoF2 feature (nameplate, target_ring, view_distance, no_fog, camera) is self-contained
with its own independently-RE'd raw RoF2 addresses and deliberately avoids this vendored layer.** Treat
the vendored `Rcp::Game::*` inventory/item/character helpers and the `InvSlot`/`InvSlotWnd`/`CInvSlotMgr`
structs as UNTRUSTWORTHY for RoF2 until each address is re-verified by disasm. eqlib
(`/home/joshua/workspace/GitHub/eqlib`) is a good RoF2 struct-SHAPE reference, but its addresses target a
DIFFERENT RoF2 build (e.g. `CInvSlot__HandleRButtonUp_x=0x697250`) and do NOT match ours — re-find every
address in our `eqgame.exe`.

### The eqlib rescue: eqlib's RoF2 build == ours
The first `/rcpequip` attempt was built on the vendored TAKP layer above and did nothing (all addresses
wrong; the InvSlotWnd RButton "hook" even patched mid-function code). It was reverted, then **rebuilt
RoF2-native** — and the key discovery that made it easy: **the eqlib fact-reference
(`/home/joshua/workspace/GitHub/eqlib`) is compiled for our EXACT build.** Its own comment reads
`@sizeof(CInvSlotMgr) == 0x2014 :: 2013-05-10` and every offset we spot-checked
(`CInvSlot::HandleRButtonUp` 0x697250, `CInvSlotWnd::HandleLButtonUp` 0x69A5D0, `pinstLocalPlayer`
0xDD2630 == target_ring's `kSelf`) lands on a clean function prologue / correct global in our
`eqgame.exe`. So eqlib's `offsets/eqgame.h` addresses AND struct offsets are directly usable. (eqlib
still targets a slightly different *patch* than some tools expect, so always confirm an address is a
clean prologue before trusting it - but for the inventory system it was 1:1.)

## Right-click to equip — `/rcpequip` (RoF2-native, DONE + confirmed in-game 2026-07-09)
Lives in `src/equip_item.cpp`, fully self-contained with stock RoF2 addresses (eqlib-sourced, disasm-
confirmed) - it does NOT touch the vendored TAKP layer. Ships OFF; `/rcpequip [on|off]` + a
"Right-click to equip" checkbox on the `/rcpoptions` **Mouse** tab (`Rcp_Equip`). Persisted to
`[EquipItem] RightClickToEquip`.

### Behavior
- **Right-click** a wearable item in a bag -> auto-equips into the first slot (priority order:
  weapons/range, armor, jewelry, charm/power-source, ammo) its `EquipSlots` bitmask allows - UNLESS the
  item is a **clicky**, in which case it falls through and the client casts it (which is what a plain
  right-click does natively). So clickies cast, plain gear equips.
- **Alt + right-click** a wearable item -> always equips (so a clicky can still be equipped).
- Everything else (the bag itself, non-wearables, worn items) falls through to the client's native
  right-click unchanged. Additive: with the feature off, or on the fall-through paths, behavior is stock.
- "Clicky" = `ItemDefinition.SpellData@0x284 -> Spells[ItemSpellType_Clicky=0].SpellID (@+0x00) > 0`
  (the first spell slot also covers mount/illusion/familiar/blessing - all right-click activatable).

### Mechanism
Detour on **`CInvSlot::HandleRButtonUp` @0x697250** (thiscall `(CInvSlot*, const CXPoint&)`; the seam
the client itself dispatches right-clicks to). Per-click:
- Source `ItemGlobalIndex` is read from `this->pInvSlotWnd@0x4 -> ItemLocation@0x264`
  (`{ int Location; short slots[3]; }`, 0x0c bytes; Possessions==0, worn 0..22, bag top-slots 23..32).
- The item is fetched via **`CInvSlot::GetItem` @0x694780** (returns an 8-byte `ItemPtr` by hidden
  return pointer; `ItemPtr[0]` is the raw `ItemClient*`). **The definition is at
  `ItemClient::SharedItemDef@0x144`** (a `SharedPtr<ItemDefinition>` in the DERIVED class - NOT
  `ItemBase::Item1@0x9c`, which is null on `ItemClient`; this cost a debugging round-trip).
  `EquipSlots` is `ItemDefinition@0xf0` (bitmask `1<<eInventorySlot`).
- Equip drives the client's own **`CInvSlotMgr::MoveItem` @0x698D80**
  (`pinstCInvSlotMgr` @0xD1FD80; args are two `ItemGlobalIndex*` + 4 bools) - it does the whole
  move/swap on indices, no `ItemClient*` needed.
- **Modifier read:** the Alt state comes from the manager's cached keyboard-flag bytes
  (`pinstCXWndManager` @0x15D3D00, `LAlt@0x9f`/`RAlt@0xa0`; these are what `GetKeyboardFlags@0x875BD0`
  reads). Plain right-click passes `skip_clicky=true` to the equip path (a clicky then falls through and
  the client's own no-Alt handler casts it); Alt passes `skip_clicky=false` (always equip). No flag
  patching / packet RE - clicky casting is just the client's native right-click that we decline to
  absorb. (An earlier version mapped it the other way and used an Alt-flag-clearing trick to force the
  cast; the current scheme is simpler because native plain-right-click already casts.)

### Reference counting
`GetItem` returns an `ItemPtr` (`VePointer<ItemClient>`, an INTRUSIVE smart pointer) by value, so the
copy bumps the object's refcount. We grab the raw pointer and immediately `InterlockedDecrement` it back
(the refcount is `VeBaseReferenceCount::ReferenceCount` @ item+0x4 - `VeBaseReferenceCount` is
`ItemBase`'s first base: `{ vtable@0x0; int ReferenceCount@0x4 }`). The inventory keeps its own
reference, so the count never hits 0 during our synchronous handler and the item stays valid; this just
balances the copy so there's no per-equip leak.

### Dropped vs Zeal
Shift/Ctrl "pick the Nth valid slot" and the empty-slot-first preference (v1 is first-fit; MoveItem
swaps if the target slot is occupied); the separate `ClickFromInventory`/`UseAltForClicky` settings
(one `/rcpequip` toggle gates both behaviors); the bard-melody queue (no melody module here).

## Chat shortcuts (Zeal `chat.cpp` percent-replacements → RoF2) — DONE (awaiting in-game confirm 2026-07-09)

`src/chat_shortcuts.cpp`. Always on (no command/toggle - the expansion is harmless when a token isn't
present). Expands short tokens typed into any OUTGOING chat line into live values, exactly like Zeal's
`DoPercentReplacements`:

- `%n`   → current mana percent (`"73%"`)
- `%h`   → current hit-point percent
- `%loc` → your location, `Y, X, Z` (client `/loc` order, 2 decimals)
- `%thp` → your target's HP percent

### Render/hook seam
Detour on **`CEverQuest::DoPercentConvert(char* line, bool bOutGoing)` @ `0x51B600`** (`__thiscall`,
`this` = the CEverQuest instance `*(0xE67CCC)` = `pinstCEverQuest`). This is the stock client function
that already expands `%t`/`%s`/… on outgoing chat, so hooking it is the natural seam. We substitute our
tokens FIRST (plain literal replace-all — the four tokens share no prefix and no replacement value
introduces a token, so order is irrelevant), then tail-call the original for the client's own tokens.

- **Confirmed offset (disasm + eqlib):** `0x51B600` starts `81 ec 0c 08 00 00` (`sub $0x80c,%esp`)
  then `push $0x25` (`'%'`) + `call 0x8dd880` (strchr) — the DoPercentConvert fingerprint. 18 callers;
  outgoing chat (say/tell/group/guild, the `0x51f4xx..0x51f8xx` dispatch cluster near InterpretCmd
  `0x51fce0`) passes `bOutGoing = 1`; the incoming/display path passes `0`. We gate on `bOutGoing` so an
  inbound message that literally contains `%h` is never rewritten.
- **⚠ STALE-OFFSET FIX:** `game_functions.h` (`GameInternal::DoPercentConvert`) and
  `game_structures.h` (`GameClass::DoPercentConvert`) both carried **`0x538110`**, a TAKP offset that
  lands **mid-function** in RoF2 (`0x538110` disassembles to `jne 0x538148`, not a prologue). It was
  dead code so nobody had hit it. Both are now corrected to `0x51B600` (would have crashed if ever
  called). Cross-checked: neighbours `dsp_chat 0x51F1A0` and `InterpretCmd 0x51FCE0` already match eqlib.

### Values
- HP%/mana% via the same client accessors the billboard nameplates use (`self_stats` in
  `font_overlay.cpp`): `pLocalPC (*(0xDD261C)) + 0x2DC8` = CharacterZoneClient `this`, then
  `Cur_HP 0x449E00 / Max_HP 0x443FA0 / Cur_Mana 0x4442E0 / Max_Mana 0x581E60`. -1 (no mana pool /
  no target) renders as `0%`.
- Loc from the local player's position floats `Y@0x64 / X@0x68 / Z@0x6c` (eqlib PlayerBase; EQ memory
  order is Y,X,Z, which is why the printed order matches `/loc`).
- Target HP% via `HpCurrent@0x2e4 / HpMax@0x2dc` (NPCs carry a bare percent in Current with Max 0 —
  same `hp_percent` fallback as nameplate.cpp).
- **⚠ Self/target pointers must be the raw eqlib globals, NOT `Rcp::Game::get_self()`/`get_target()`.**
  Those helpers dereference the STALE-TAKP `game_addresses.h` globals (`Self 0x7F94CC`, `Target
  0x7F94EC`) which are null on RoF2 — the first cut read `0` for `%loc`/`%thp` because of exactly this.
  Use the confirmed globals `pinstLocalPlayer *(0xDD2630)` and `pinstTarget *(0xDD2648)` directly (as
  target_ring.cpp / nameplate.cpp do). `%n`/`%h` were unaffected because they already read
  `pinstLocalPC *(0xDD261C)`.

### Safety
Game-memory reads happen inside `rcp_guard::run`; the `std::string` build/replace runs AFTER the guard
(heap-only, can't fault). Write-back is bounded to 2000 bytes, comfortably under the client's own
`0x800` working buffer that every DoPercentConvert caller must already provide.

---

## Disable sounds by name (`src/sound_mods.cpp`, `/rcpsound`) — DONE (awaiting in-game confirm)

Goal: an in-game way to mute specific game sounds, starting with the storm **thunder** (`thunder1.wav`
/ `thunder2.wav`, packaged in `snd2.pfs`), via a **"Sounds" tab** in `/rcpoptions`, structured so more
sound types can be added later. Toggling mutes/unmutes **instantly, both directions** (no zoning).

### Key finding — RoF2 sound architecture (all disasm-verified against the mss32.dll call graph)
The exe **never names individual wavs** (thunder1/2.wav come from the packaged data, not code — a
`strings eqgame.exe | grep thunder` only hits zone names). Sounds are loaded by filename into an
**audio-asset object**, then played by index, so name-based filtering must happen where the asset is
known. The RE that pinned the seam:
- **Audio-asset ctor `0x5BE830`** (`__thiscall`, `ret 0x14` = 5 args): copies the source filename into
  an **inline buffer at `asset+0x8`**, detects the extension (`strrchr('.')`) and stores a **format at
  `asset+0x210`** (1=`.wav`, 2=`.mp3`, 3=`.ogg`, 4=`.xmi`), plus the file bytes `@+0x208` and size
  `@+0x20c`. So every asset retains its own filename.
- **The single play choke is `Asset::Play` @ `0x5BFBD0`** — `__thiscall(this=asset, void* param)`,
  `ret 4`. It reads `this+0x210`/`+0x214`, dispatches 2D/3D/stream by format, and does the positional
  attenuation, so **every** sound start funnels through it. Its main caller, the "play sound at index N"
  helper `0x4A9140`, is called from all over the binary (combat, spells, UI, weather). The function's
  own null/early-outs `xor eax,eax; ret 4`, so **returning 0 without calling the original cleanly
  suppresses a sound** — a "did not play" result callers already handle.
- Miles (`mss32.dll`) sits one layer below and is **name-blind**: 2D loads via
  `AIL_set_named_sample_file` pass only a **format tag** string (`.mp3`/`.wav`/`.ogg` @ `0x9ca298`/
  `0x9ca308`/`0x9d93dc`), not the wav name; 3D uses `AIL_set_3D_sample_file` (image only). The IAT lives
  at VA `0x9C04D4` (= winedump import offset + image base `0x400000`); the load/play wrappers cluster at
  `0x5BE000..0x5BFA00`. So hooking Miles can't filter by name — the asset layer is the right seam.

### Mechanism — one detour on `Asset::Play`, live name check (mute) + gain scale (volume)
`sound_mods.cpp` detours `0x5BFBD0`. Every play, it reads `(char*)(this+0x8)` **inside `rcp_guard::run`**
(a raw read that could fault on a stale asset), then does all string/map work AFTER the guard (heap-only,
can't fault — same split as `chat_shortcuts.cpp`). Two levers, both **per-play against the live setting**
so they take effect **instantly, both directions, with no data destruction and no zoning** — no need to
locate the SoundManager instance or sweep loaded assets (both considered and rejected as more surface):
- **Mute** → `return 0` (skip), the value the function's own null/early-outs already produce.
- **Volume** → the play request `param`'s first float (`param+0x0`) is the **requested gain** (Play
  early-outs silently when it is ≤ 0), so we transiently `*param *= pct/100`, call the original, then
  **restore** `*param` (the caller's struct is left untouched; Play copies the gain into its queued
  instance synchronously, so restoring after it returns is safe). `param == null` (some default-volume
  2D sounds) → volume can't scale, but mute still works.

**CONFIRMED in-game 2026-07-09** (thunder muting). The `param+0x0` = linear-gain assumption still needs
an in-game check for the volume path (the ≤0→silent gate strongly implies it); mute is proven.

### History + per-sound overrides (dynamic management)
The hook also records a bounded **history** (`std::map<stem, {display, count, last_tick, vol_pct}>`,
`GetTickCount` for recency, capped 512, guarded by a `std::mutex` since the play hook and the chat
commands both touch it). `vol_pct`: −1 = no override (100%), 0 = mute, 1..100 = volume. Preset **named
categories** (`SoundCategory`, seeded `thunder → {thunder1.wav, thunder2.wav}`) remain for the tab
checkbox; the play hook mutes if the stem is in an enabled category OR its `vol_pct == 0`, and scales if
`0 < vol_pct < 100`. All matching is on the **basename stem** (lowercased, path/ext-insensitive).

Commands (`/rcpsound`): `recent [N]` lists the newest-first played sounds numbered (with count + %/MUTED
state, caching index→stem for `#` refs); `vol <name|#> <0-100>` sets a sound's volume (0 = mute; a
`<name>` is stem-matched so it works for not-yet-played sounds, a `<#>` indexes the last `recent` list);
`reset <name|#>` stops tracking a sound; `thunder on|off` (category); `log on|off` (file log of distinct
names); `clear` (wipe history, keep overrides); bare = status. (`mute`/`unmute` were dropped per user —
`vol 0` mutes.) Per-sound overrides persist to a dedicated **`[SoundOverrides]`** section (key = stem,
value = percent; `deleteKey` on reset) via two new `IO_ini` helpers (`getSection`, `deleteKey`);
categories/log stay in `[Sounds]`.

### Sounds tab — the tracked-sound manager (DONE)
The **"Sounds" tab** (tab index 6; tab strip grew 6→7, window widened 424→**492**, tab-6 right edge 478)
is a curated **tracked-sound list** (the preset "Disable thunder" checkbox was removed 2026-07-09 —
redundant once thunder can be muted from the list like any other sound; the `/rcpsound thunder` command +
category backend were kept, and the remaining controls shifted up ~28px, 100 controls): an **"Add a
played sound" combobox** (populated from `sound_settings::get_recent_untracked(30)` — recently-played sounds not yet
tracked), up to **`kSndRowCount`(10) row buttons** (each shows `name    NN%`/`MUTED`; click selects it,
radio-style like the tab strip), a **volume slider** (0..100, 0 = mute) + value label bound to the
selected row, and a **"Remove selected from list"** button. All poll-driven (no `WndNotification`),
mirroring the Colors-tab role buttons + Ring-tab combobox. `refresh_sound_list()` repaints rows only when
a signature of the list changes (so it doesn't fight the user or spam `SetWindowText`); a
`snd_selection_dirty_` flag snaps the slider to the selection's volume on a select/add/remove, and the
slider is left alone mid-drag (its `set_volume` updates the row text live). Adding a sound selects it;
removing it clears the selection and returns it to the add combo. `sound_settings` exposes
`get_tracked` / `get_recent_untracked` / `add_tracked` (returns the stem) / `set_volume` /
`remove_tracked`. Regen order unchanged (`gen_option_overrides.py` then `gen_rcp_options_ui.py`, **101
controls**).

**In-game verification (user):** open the Sounds tab, pick a recently-played sound from the combobox → it
appears as a row; click the row and drag the volume slider (row text updates live); "Remove selected"
drops it. Commands `/rcpsound recent`, `vol 3 50`, `reset 3` do the same. If `vol` doesn't audibly change
a sound (only 0/mute does), `param+0x0` is a gate not the output gain and the volume lever needs re-RE
(the queued-instance gain field / the `AIL_set_sample_volume_levels @0x9c053c` path). Built + installed
2026-07-09.

**Bugfix (2026-07-09):** persisted overrides loaded fine (verified `GetPrivateProfileSectionA` + the
`[SoundOverrides]` read under Wine) but the tracked list rendered EMPTY on window open until the user
interacted. Cause: `refresh_sound_list`'s content-signature guard skipped the repaint on tab entry while
`set_active_tab` had hidden the rows on other tabs, so an unchanged list never re-`show_window`'d them on
return. Fix: `set_active_tab` clears `snd_list_sig_` and always calls `refresh_sound_list` (forcing a
repaint on any tab change), and each row's `show_window` is gated on `active_tab_ == 6`.

**Scrollable-list upgrade (2026-07-09):** the 10 fixed row buttons were replaced by a native **`CListWnd`**
(`Rcp_SndList`) so the tracked list scrolls to any count. SIDL is the stock `<Listbox>` schema (one
`<Columns><Width>` + `Style_VScroll`, modeled on `FW_FriendsList`). CListWnd methods (eqlib +
disasm-verified against our build — `GetCurSel@0x853430` reads `CurSel@this+0x1f8` vs row count
`ItemsArray.m_length@this+0x1d8`): `AddString@0x8580C0`, `GetCurSel@0x853430`, `SetCurSel@0x853470`,
`SetItemText@0x8575B0`, `RemoveLine@0x8582A0`; row count `*(int*)(list+0x1d8)`. Thin wrappers in
`rcp_options_ui.cpp` (all gated on non-null). `refresh_sound_list` now rebuilds the list only on a
**structural** change (the stem set differs); a volume-only edit updates just the changed row via
`SetItemText`, preserving scroll position + selection. Row selection is the list's own polled `GetCurSel`
(no more checkbox rows). This is the first standalone `CListWnd` in the mod — **awaiting in-game verify**
that a runtime-instantiated list renders, routes row clicks, and scrolls.

### Floating combat damage (`/rcpfcd`, `src/floating_damage.{h,cpp}`) - Zeal floating_damage port

Rising/fading damage numbers over each entity as it is struck (the classic Zeal "floating combat
text"). Off by default; `/rcpfcd` toggles + subcommands, and a new `/rcpoptions` **"Combat" tab**.
Persisted to `[FloatingDamage]`.

- **Damage source = detour on `CEverQuest::ReportSuccessfulHit` @ `0x52EE40`** (eqlib, which is
  compiled for our exact `__ClientDate 20130510` build), `bool ReportSuccessfulHit(EQSuccessfulHit*,
  bool output_text, int)` - a `__thiscall`; detoured with the standard `__fastcall(this, edx, ...)`
  idiom. This is the same function Zeal hooks on TAKP (Zeal's `0x5297D2`). **The repo's
  `callbacks.cpp` already had a copy of Zeal's `ReportSuccessfulHit` but with the STALE TAKP offset
  `0x5297D2` and the TAKP `Damage_Struct` layout, inside the dead/uninstantiated `CallbackManager` -
  do NOT use it.** The correct RoF2 struct is eqlib's **`EQSuccessfulHit`** (packed): `DamagedID`
  u16@0, `AttackerID` u16@2, `Skill` u8@4, `SpellID` i32@5, `DamageCaused` i32@9 - field sizes differ
  from the TAKP `Damage_Struct` (there `type`/`spellid`/`damage` are all 16-bit).
- **Rendering = 3-D billboard (`SpriteFont`) at the shared pre-UI seam** (`font_overlay::add_scene_draw`),
  reusing the in-game-confirmed nameplate path + the `arial_bold_24` atlas. Head anchor is the model's
  name-sprite world pos (`actor@0x101c` -> `CStringSprite@0x204` -> pos@`+0x6c/0x70/0x74`), fallback
  feet+`AvatarHeight@0x138` - identical to `on_render_nameplates`. Numbers rise in world-Z + fade over
  ~2.2 s (big hits 3 s, larger, own color). Scale is a per-flush font setting, so normal vs big hits
  are bucketed into two flushes.
- **No risky offsets in the hot path.** Categorization (mine / to-me / other) is by comparing the
  resolved source/target pointers to the `self`/`controlled` globals (`0xDD2630`/`0xDD2644`); pet
  detection reads eqlib `SpawnID@0x148` / `MasterID@0x38c` (same PlayerBase struct as the confirmed
  pos/heading offsets) but only inside the crash guard, and a wrong read only mis-colors. Spawn-id ->
  entity via `Rcp::Game::get_entity_by_id` (`EntityIdArray@0x0078c47c`, size 5000; `pinstSpawnManager
  0xE641D0` matches eqlib, so the array base is trusted). **Note: `game_structures.h`'s `Entity` struct
  (SpawnId@0x94, Type@0xa8, Position@0x48) is the STALE TAKP layout - do NOT read spawn fields through
  it; use the raw eqlib offsets like target_ring/font_overlay do.**
- **Threading:** the hit detour fires on the main thread, the draw on the render thread. A `std::mutex`
  guards the active-number list; the detour builds primitives under the crash guard (no lock/dtor
  inside the guard, so a longjmp can't strand the mutex), then pushes under the lock OUTSIDE the guard;
  the draw snapshots+expires under the lock, then renders without it.
- **Options "Combat" tab** (9th tab; window widened to `CX=624`): enable + 5 filter checkboxes
  (mine/incoming/others/melee/spells) + big-hit threshold slider (0..2000) + 4 color swatches
  (sentinel picker roles `101..104`, mirroring the ring's `100`). Kept to ONE general tab per user
  request (avoid granular tabs).
- **CONFIRMED in-game 2026-07-09.** Tuning constants (`kScaleNormal/Big`, `kBaseLift`, `kRiseWorld`,
  `kJitter`, durations) are at the top of the .cpp if the size/height/scatter want adjusting.
- **First-test bug (fixed):** nothing appeared because the spawn-id -> entity lookup used the vendored
  `Rcp::Game::get_entity_by_id` (flat `EntityIdArray@0x0078c47c`), a **STALE TAKP address on RoF2** that
  returns a garbage pointer - reading a field off it faulted every hit (the crash guard swallowed
  `ACCESS_VIOLATION in 'fcd.classify'`, so it failed silently, no numbers). Disasm of ReportSuccessfulHit
  itself (`mov ecx,[0xE641D0]; push id; call 0x5996E0`) + eqlib gave the real lookup:
  **`PlayerManagerClient::GetSpawnByID(int) @ 0x5996E0`, this = pinstSpawnManager `*(void**)0xE641D0`,
  `__thiscall`** - the module now uses a local `get_spawn_by_id()`. The detour ABI and the
  `EQSuccessfulHit` field reads were correct all along; only the lookup was stale. **General lesson:
  `get_entity_by_id` is unreliable on RoF2 - prefer `GetSpawnByID@0x5996E0`.**

## Extra /hidecorpses options: always + showlast (`src/hide_corpse.{h,cpp}`) — DONE (awaiting in-game confirm)

**Extends the stock `/hidecorpses` command** (does NOT add a separate command) with the two conveniences
RoF2 native lacks: `/hidecorpses always` (keep every NPC corpse hidden, including ones that spawn after
the command) and `/hidecorpses showlast` (reveal the single most-recently-hidden corpse so you can loot
it). Player corpses (incl. your own) are never hidden. The command hook intercepts `/hidecorpses`, handles
`always`/`showlast`/`debug` (returns true), and **returns false for the native keywords + no-arg so the
stock handler still runs** (case-insensitive; `none` also cancels `always` so the scan stops re-hiding).

### Native `/hidecorpses` is plural, one-shot, and server-mediated (so both features are genuinely new)
- The native command is **`/hidecorpses`** (plural, handler `0x4E78C0`), not `/hidecorpse`. Its option
  keywords are string-DB resources (not ASCII in the exe — that's why they don't grep): id `0x3395`=ALL,
  `0x3397`=ALLBUTGROUP, `0x33F6`=LOOTED, `0x18D6`=NPC, plus NONE. Usage text (id 0x3392/0x3393) states
  *"any corpses created after use of this command will not be hidden"* and *"your own corpse(s) will
  never be hidden."* Every mode just enqueues the mode to the server via `0x8C51F0` (a mutex-guarded
  message queue on the connection object `0xDD25AC`) + sets a LOOTED byte at `camera+0x14` (camera =
  `*(void**)0xDD2660`). There is **no continuous mode, no showlast, and no callable local "hide all
  spawns" function** — so we add those two keywords to the command itself and forward the native ones.

### Model-hide primitive — reuse the client's own `/hideme` field (do NOT reinvent)
- **Write `spawn+0x338` (int32): `3001` (0xBB9) = invisible, `0` = visible.** This is exactly what the
  GM `/hideme` command (handler `0x4FBB40`) toggles. The spawn vtable setter `[+0xD8] = 0x597F30` is
  literally `mov [ecx+0x338], arg; ret 4`, so a **direct field write is identical to the client's own
  path and avoids any indirect-call risk** (hide_model/show_model write the field directly, only when it
  differs, to avoid re-triggering the refresh each frame). eqstr confirms semantics: id 0x3296 "%1 is now
  Invisible.", 0x3297 "%1 is now Visible." The client's per-frame spawn processing `0x4592B0` reads this
  field and calls actor-refresh `0x434090` — so the render loop honours it; our EndScene scan re-asserts
  it every frame, which keeps a corpse hidden even if the client consumes/clears the field between frames.
  A name-sprite reader at `0x58E822` also treats `[spawn+0x338]>0` as invisible. **Note the offset aliases
  to a POINTER on a different object class (`0x6C93B9`/`0x70222E`) — only write it on spawns walked from
  the PlayerManagerClient list, which are PlayerClient-layout.** If a set alone ever fails to re-cull the
  3D model in-game, add `reinterpret_cast<void(__thiscall*)(void*)>(0x434090)(spawn)` after the write.

### NPC-vs-PC corpse — no clean field; name-shape heuristic (protects your own corpse)
- `type@0x125` ∈ {0=Player,1=NPC,2=Corpse} only (verified: **no value 3 anywhere**; `IsCorpse` at
  `0x8CFCD0` = `cmp [ecx+0x125],2`), so it can't tell an NPC corpse from a player corpse — that split is
  server-side in native `/hidecorpses NPC`. Heuristic: a corpse's display name (`+0xe4`) is
  "<Base>'s corpse"; take the part before the `'`; if <Base> is a single **capitalized all-alpha token**
  it's a PLAYER corpse → never hidden (EQ player names can't contain space/digit/underscore, so this
  always protects your own corpse). Everything else ("a bat", "an orc pawn", "Lord Nagafen",
  "gnoll_pup039") is hidden. Only miss: a single-token capitalized *named* NPC stays visible.
  **`/hidecorpses debug`** dumps the target's name/type/`+0x338`/`+0x150`(fork's candidate discriminator,
  getter `0x8CFCE0`)/spawnid so a clean PC/NPC field can be pinned in-game and replace the heuristic.

### Design + shared offsets
- Spawn walk (confirmed, shared w/ font_overlay): mgr `*(void**)0xE641D0` → head `+0x08`, next `+0x08`;
  type `+0x125`; actor(CActorInterface*) `+0x101c`; SpawnID(u32) `+0x148`; name `+0xe4`; self
  `*(void**)0xDD2630`; target `*(void**)0xDD2648`. Show-last validates via `GetSpawnByID@0x5996E0`
  (this=`*0xE641D0`), never the stale vendored lookup.
- `always` = persisted `[HideCorpse] Always`; a `directx::add_render_callback` (EndScene) scan hides
  every non-revealed NPC corpse and records the most-recently-newly-hidden as "last". `showlast` un-hides
  that one and adds it to a `revealed` map (validated by id→ptr) so the scan won't re-hide it; toggling
  `always` off reveals everything we hid. `g_writes_armed` is a master kill-switch (ships true because
  the field write is safe).
- **Dead ends (don't retry):** TAKP `ActorInfo->IsInvisible` / `ViewActor->Flags |= 0x40000000` is stale
  on RoF2 (DPVS engine; the DLL's only 0x40000000 tests are CPUID/format false-positives); the
  `Active_Corpse` global `0x7f9500` has **0 xrefs** (stale); native `/hidecorpses` can't be driven
  locally (server round-trip); the CActorInterface `+0x101c` vtable route is 133+ entries with unresolved
  RTTI — the `/hideme` `+0x338` field is simpler and is the client's own path.

## Automatic AA experience (`src/aa_exp.cpp`, `/rcpaaexp`) — DONE (awaiting in-game confirm)

Gate AA experience on/off by how far into the current level you are: pick a THRESHOLD (0-100% of the
current level's XP bar) and an ACTIVE % (0-100%, snapped to native 10% steps). Each ~1s tick, in game:
`level XP% < threshold → set AA % to 0`, else `→ set AA % to ACTIVE`. Enable + both sliders live on the
**General tab** of `/rcpoptions` (`Rcp_AaExpEnabled` / `Rcp_AaExpThresh` / `Rcp_AaExpActive` +
`Rcp_AaExpStatus` live readout). `[Experience]` ini, off by default. Enforcement runs from
`ProcessGameEvents_hk` (`aa_exp::on_frame`, throttled + `rcp_guard`), like `window_watch`.

**Why a bare field write is not enough:** the SERVER owns the level-XP-vs-AA split; the client only tells
it "my AA % is N" when the AA-window slider moves. So the mod must reproduce that write+send.

**Verified levers (disasm-confirmed against 4+ independent sites; `pLocalPC = *(void**)0xDD261C`):**
- `PercentEXPtoAA` — **`pLocalPC + 0x2081`** (uint8, 0..100). This IS the AA-window slider value. Read at
  `0x607c48`, `0x60a125`; the native +/- buttons step it ±10 clamped to 0x64 at `0x60aaee` / `0x60ab21`.
- `Exp` — **`pLocalPC + 0x2910`** (int64), experience **WITHIN the current level, range 0..330** (NOT
  cumulative; hi dword forced 0 at `0x4b707c`). **level XP% = `Exp * 100 / 330`** (client const 100/330 =
  `0x9fb5f8`). eqlib comment: "divide with 3.30f and you get the percent."
- **Set + server-sync = write the byte, then `call 0x607C40`** — `void __cdecl(void)`, no args: it reads
  `pLocalPC+0x2081`, builds the 18-byte packet at `0xDD00E0` (logical opcode **`0x424e`**, flag 1=on/2=off
  at +2, value at +0xE), and sends on `UdpConnection::Send`(`0x8C51F0`) channel 4. Bails if world
  (`*0xDD25AC`) is null, so it is safe off-world. This is exactly what CAAWnd's +/- handlers call.
- Optional cosmetic repaint if the AA window is open: `CAAWnd::Update` `0x609F90` (`this = *(void**)0xD1FC20`,
  guard non-null). Not needed for the packet.

**KEY OFFSET GOTCHA:** these exp/AA data fields are at `pLocalPC + offset` **directly** — NOT via the
`+0x2DC8` `CharacterZoneClient` base. That `+0x2DC8` is only the `this` for the `Cur_/Max_` **vtable**
accessors (see `chat_shortcuts.cpp` HP/mana); the raw fields are pLocalPC-relative (eqlib PcClient
offset-comments, confirmed in disasm: same fn `0x762468` does `lea 0x2dc8; call Cur_HP` for HP but reads
Exp/AAExp with no adjustment).

**Caveat (untested):** at MAX level the within-level `Exp` reporting is unverified — if it reads 0 the gate
would force AA to 0 there. Disable the feature at max level if it misbehaves. The server-side `OP_*` name
for opcode `0x424e` is not in the client binary (would need the emu opcode map); not needed by the mod.

## Chat clipboard copy/paste (`src/chat_clipboard.cpp`) — DONE (awaiting in-game confirm 2026-07-16)

Zeal's `chat.cpp` "ZealInput" copy/paste (Ctrl+C/X/V in the chat edit box), ported to stock RoF2. Always on,
no command, no options tab — copy/paste is universally-expected behaviour.

### Key finding — RoF2 can paste but physically CANNOT copy, and native paste never fires in chat
Import-table scan of `eqgame.exe` (authoritative): `OpenClipboard` / `GetClipboardData` / `CloseClipboard`
are imported (IAT `0x9c0380` / `0x9c0384` / `0x9c0388`), but **`SetClipboardData` and `EmptyClipboard` are
absent from the entire binary** — the client was compiled without them, so it can read the OS clipboard
(paste) but can never write it (copy). Our injected DLL imports the full user32 clipboard API, so we supply
the missing copy side ourselves.

Native paste IS present (the read path at `0x4daeeb`: `OpenClipboard`→`GetClipboardData(CF_TEXT)`→`GlobalLock`,
filters control chars→space, then `ReplaceSelection`), but it lives inside `ExecuteCmd` (`0x4D7230`) as the
`CMD_CLIPBOARD_PASTE` keymap command. While you are typing in an edit box, `CXWndManager::HandleKeyboardMsg`
routes the key straight to the focused window and the keymap is never scanned (see the keybinds.cpp note), so
that command can't fire in chat. That is why paste is dead in-game even though the code exists.

### Mechanism — one detour on the UI keyboard choke point
Detour `CXWndManager::HandleKeyboardMsg` @ **`0x876530`** — `__thiscall(uint32 dikScanCode, uint32 down)`,
`ret 0x8`. `KeypressHandler::HandleKeyDown` (`0x5594E0`) calls it FIRST and, iff it returns **0** (consumed),
skips the keymap scan (`test eax,eax; je past-keymap` at `0x559508`). So **return 0 = swallow the key**; any
non-zero = let the keymap run. This is the raw-keystroke seam (bypasses the whole keymap/command system),
the RoF2 analog of Zeal's `EditWndHandleKey` hook.

Disasm of `0x876530` gave the members/vtable we use:
- Ctrl state byte `[mgr+0x9e]` (set by the LCONTROL `0x1d` / RCONTROL `0x9d` scancode handlers; a scancode
  jump table at `0x876758`/`0x876740` maps `0x1d/0x9d→+0x9e Ctrl`, `0x2a/0x36→+0x9d Shift`, alts→`+0x9f/+0xa0`).
- Focus window ptr `[mgr+0x64]`.
- Target edit box = `focus->GetActiveEditWnd()` (CXWnd vtable **`+0x15c`**, eqlib) — returns null for non-edit
  windows, so it doubles as the "is this an edit box" test. This is the exact call the native paste path uses.

Per key (keydown + Ctrl held + focus resolves to an edit box; else fall through to original):
- **Ctrl+C (`0x2e`) / Ctrl+X (`0x2d`)**: read the selection `InputText[StartPos..EndPos)` and `SetClipboardData`.
  Cut also deletes via `ReplaceSelection(edit,"",1)`.
- **Ctrl+V (`0x2f`)**: `GetClipboardData`, collapse control chars (incl. newlines) to spaces (matches the stock
  paste filter so a multi-line paste stays one chat line), `ReplaceSelection(edit, text, 1)`.

### Offsets (eqlib + disasm, May 10 2013 build)
- `CEditBaseWnd`: `StartPos@0x1dc`, `EndPos@0x1e0`, `InputText(CXStr = CStrRep*)@0x1ec` (eqlib UI.h).
- `CStrRep`: `length@0x08`, `encoding@0x0c` (0 = Utf8/ASCII; we handle ASCII only for now), inline `data@0x14`
  (eqlib CXStr.h).
- `CEditWnd::ReplaceSelection(char ch, bool bFilter)` @ **`0x87d0e0`** — the **SINGLE-CHAR** overload (builds
  a 1-char CXStr from the arg's low byte via the char ctor `0x805be0`: `[rep+8]=1; [rep+0x14]=byte`). **NOT a
  char\*** — the v1 bug passed `text.c_str()` here and pasted one `(` (the pointer's low byte `0x28`). Paste
  correctly = feed the clipboard one char at a time (first call replaces the selection, each next inserts at
  the advancing caret); no CXStr lifetime to manage.
- `CEditWnd::ReplaceSelection(CXStr, bool bFilter)` @ **`0x87CD30`** — the CXStr overload; a **null rep ==
  empty string == delete the selection** (it null-checks the rep and no-ops on the read-only style bit
  `ewsReadOnly 0x200000`). Used only for cut's delete, so no CXStr allocation/refcount is needed.
- DIK scancodes C `0x2e` / V `0x2f` / X `0x2d` — same values Zeal keys off of.

### Landmine avoided
The vendored `game_ui.h` `EditWnd`/`CXSTR` offsets (`ReplaceSelection 0x5a41b0`, `CXSTR` methods `0x575xxx`)
are STALE Titanium/TAKP — using them would crash. All addresses here are the eqlib RoF2 build's own. Also the
older `BaseVTable` in `game_ui.h` puts `SetWindowText@0xEC`; eqlib's authoritative CXWnd vtable has it at
`+0x124` and `HandleKeyboardMsg@+0x68`, `GetActiveEditWnd@+0x15c` — use eqlib.

### Copy only reaches the INPUT line — history is a CStmlWnd (no selection)
`GetActiveEditWnd` returns the chat **input** line only (a `CEditWnd`). The scrollback/**history is a
`CStmlWnd`** (STML rich-text: `CChatWindow.InputWnd@0x224` = CEditWnd, `OutputWnd@0x228` = CStmlWnd), which
has **no text-selection mechanism at all** — that is why you cannot drag-highlight chat history, and why copy
can never reach it through this hook. This is a real RoF2 limitation (Zeal had the same: input-line copy
only). Ctrl+C therefore copies the input line (the highlighted range, or the whole line if nothing is
selected — also handy for confirming the copy→OS-clipboard path works).

**Copying from history is a separate, unbuilt feature.** CStmlWnd exposes no `GetSelectedText`; the raw
material is `STMLText@0x1d8` (full buffer, with markup tags), `TextLines@0x1dc`
(`CircularArrayClass2<STextLine>`), `Links@0x210`, and `GetVisibleText @ 0x8803C0`. Candidate designs:
click/modifier-click a line to copy it; a "copy whole window" hotkey/command; or full drag-to-highlight (track
the drag over TextLines, render the highlight, extract + tag-strip). Pick per the user.

Item-link tags in a copied input selection are not expanded (rare). Unicode (non-ASCII) selections are skipped
by copy for now.

## Classic spell icons — live texture swap (`src/spell_icons.cpp`, `/rcpspellicons`) — DONE (awaiting in-game confirm 2026-07-20)

The Feb-2013 icon revamp replaced the ART inside the ten sheet files the UI has always used:
`Spells01-07.tga` (the `A_SpellIcons` 40x40 grid — spell book, buffs, casting bar, item effects) and
`gemicons01-03.tga` (the `A_SpellGems` 24x24 grid — spell-gem fills), both defined in
`EQUI_Animations.xml`. Players restore the old icons by overwriting those files and restarting; this
feature does it **live** at the texture level instead, either direction, with no file changes.

**The seam (all eqlib `game/UI.h` + `graphics/GraphicsResources.h`, 2013-05-10 layouts):** every UI
draw of a sheet resolves the frame's `CUITextureInfo` through the ONE global `CEQSuiteTextureLoader`
— a **static instance at `0xB64CEC`** (eqlib casts the address itself; NOT a pointer slot) — whose
`ArrayClass<_SuiteTexture>` at +0x04 is `{int len; _SuiteTexture* arr}`. Each 0x10-stride entry:
`bool bUsed@0, CXStr Name@4, enDir@8, BMI*@0xC`; `BMI = {char* Name@0, uint Flags@4, CEQGBitmap*
pBmp@8}`; `CEQGBitmap` has `char* m_pszFileName@0x28`, `bool m_bHasTexture@0x44`,
`IDirect3DTexture9* m_pD3DTexture@0x48`. Widgets keep private `CTextureAnimation` copies, but a copy
only carries the sheet NAME/id — every draw funnels back to the same per-sheet `CEQGBitmap`. So
**writing `m_pD3DTexture` on ten bitmaps swaps every spell icon in the game at once.**

Implementation: classic sheets ship as `uifiles/rcp/spellicons/*.tga` (TAKP/Quarm stock dump = the
pre-2013 originals; provenance in that folder's README), lazily `D3DXCreateTextureFromFileA`'d
(managed pool) on the render thread. A prerender (BeginScene) callback resolves the ten loader
entries, validates the records per frame (index/BMI/bitmap pointer compares), and installs/restores
the texture pointer.

**Resolution lesson (cost one in-game round-trip):** matching loader entries by `BMI.Name` /
`CEQGBitmap.m_pszFileName` basenames found only **1/10** sheets (gemicons02) — those char* fields
are NOT reliably the sheet filename for skin textures. `GetTexture@0x88AA20` disasm shows the cache
is **TextureId-keyed** (`CUITextureInfo.TextureId@+0x14` indexes the array directly; the entry's own
key is a **CXStr** at entry+0x04). The fix resolves via the **animations that the icon draws
actually use**: the SIDL manager (`pinstCSidlManager @0x15D3D08`) keeps
`ArrayClass<CTextureAnimation*>` at `+0x94/+0x98` (what `FindAnimation1@0x86E010` hashes over —
walked read-only on the render thread instead of calling it, since its CXStr temp would allocate
from the wrong thread); find `A_SpellIcons`/`A_SpellGems` by Name (CXStr@anim+0x04), then each
frame (`Frames` ArrayClass @+0x08/+0x0C, stride 0x34) carries `Piece.m_info` = `{bValid@0, Dir@4,
Name CXStr@8, TextureId@0x14}` → TextureId → loader entry. Fallback: full array walk matching the
entry CXStr key + both char* names. `/rcpspellicons dump` logs both animations' frames + every used
cache entry for diagnosis. COM refcounts: one base ref per classic
texture for the process lifetime + one `AddRef` per install so an engine teardown
(`UnloadAllTextures` on `/loadskin`, camp) safely consumes the engine's ref; a consumed install
orphans the displaced original texture (the bitmap held its only handle), so we `Release` the saved
original and re-resolve fresh. Only bitmaps with `m_bHasTexture` set are touched (the union holds a
raw-bitmap pointer until then). Missing .tga files degrade per-sheet (that sheet keeps revamped
art) with a one-time chat warning if none load.

Settings: ini `[SpellIcons] Classic`, `/rcpspellicons on|off|status|debug` (alias `/rcpicons`),
`Rcp_ClassicSpellIcons` checkbox on the Display tab. Since the swap is resolution-agnostic (the
engine normalizes UVs by the bitmap's own 256x256 `m_uWidth`, not the live texture size), HD icon
packs dropped into `uifiles/rcp/spellicons/` would also work unmodified.

## Device-reset crash on window resize (`"reset device failed"`) — FIXED 2026-07-20

### The bug
Resizing the client window makes EQGraphicsDX9 call `IDirect3DDevice9::Reset`
(`CRender::ResetDevice`). D3D9's contract: Reset FAILS (`D3DERR_INVALIDCALL`) while **any
`D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` resource is still alive** — and DXVK enforces this. The client retries a
couple of parameter variants (`"Retrying without lockable backbuffer"` etc.), but with a
foreign default-pool resource alive every retry fails and it aborts (`"ResetDevice()
failed!"` / `CRender::ResetDevice: Reset failed.` — strings in EQGraphicsDX9.dll).

The mod held exactly that: `bitmap_font.cpp` keeps its glyph **vertex/index buffers in
`D3DPOOL_DEFAULT`** (`flush_queue_to_screen`/`create_index_buffer`) for the life of each
font, and nameplates/floating-damage keep a font alive all session. The post-reset self-heal
(lazy buffer recreate + `Lock`-failure recovery) existed, but nothing released the buffers
BEFORE Reset — so Reset itself could never succeed. (All the mod's textures — font atlas,
target rings, spell-icon sheets — are `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` and neither block nor die in a Reset.)

### The fix (three pieces)
- **`directx.cpp`: Reset hook + seam** — vtable **slot 16** swapped alongside
  BeginScene(41)/EndScene(42). `directx::add_reset_callback(cb)` runs each callback (rcp_guard
  wrapped) BEFORE chaining to the real Reset; the hook logs the new backbuffer size and the
  Reset HRESULT. Runs on the render thread; the device interface pointer survives Reset.
- **`bitmap_font.cpp`: live-font registry** — every `BitmapFontBase` registers in ctor /
  unregisters in dtor (mutex-guarded); the first font arms one reset callback that calls
  `BitmapFontBase::on_device_reset()` → `release_buffers()` on every live font. Owners
  (font_overlay, floating_damage) need no changes — the next flush recreates buffers.
- **`spell_icons.cpp`: pre-reset uninstall** — the displaced ENGINE textures we hold in
  `s.orig` are of unknown pool, so before Reset every installed sheet is restored
  (`*slot = orig`, install ref released, records dropped). The engine's cache goes through
  Reset in stock state; the next `frame_tick` re-resolves and re-installs automatically.

Nothing else in the mod owns default-pool resources (`DrawPrimitiveUP` ring geometry is
driver-transient). Rule for future features: any persistent `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` object MUST
register a `directx::add_reset_callback` that releases it, and recreate lazily on draw.
